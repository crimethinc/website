<p>
These travesties will continue without mercy or quarter until all our demands
are met. This is not negotiable. These are no idle threats. Hell, all these
things are happening right now, and have been for decades.</p>
<h3> We have demands, which we make upon every man, <br />
woman,
girl, and boy:</h3>
<p>
-Each individual should seek a life that will constantly broaden her horizons,
that will give her the experiences she needs to discern exactly what her
greatest desires are. The important things cannot be taught or explained.
Go search.</p><p>
-We need to create ways of satisfying our individual needs that simultaneously
provide for the needs of others. Otherwise, every time we take care of our
own needs, we simply reinforce the system of scarcity that makes others
suffer&#151;and it is in no one&#146;s best interest that we live in a world
of mutual distrust and misery.</p><p>
-Gift giving must replace exchange as the standard economic, social, and
emotional transaction. And while everything still belongs to the hoarding
exchangers (the &#147;possessed,&#148; we call them, those would-be possessors),
let theft, squatting, trash scavenging, etc. enable us to begin this gift
economy immediately.</p><p>
-We need control over all the resources of this society, not just the fragments
we receive as individual consolation prizes, and we need social arrangements
in which this control can be shared to everyone&#146;s advantage. It&#146;s
not just a question of being free to pursue our desires, but even more so
of being able to participate in the shaping of them&#151;and for that, we
must share power over the world that does the shaping.</p><p>
We have the guns for war. They are the simple, infectious pleasure of breaking
rules&#151;the loneliness shared by prom queens and executives on long business
trips alike, both ready to abdicate their roles the instant someone offers
them a world populated by people rather than chess pieces &#151;the outrage
rightly felt by anyone who has had to go fruitlessly in search of a restroom
through the crowded streets of a city, who feels in his very gut just how
out of place human beings are in these new metropolises.</p>
<p> What we need is a new radicalism, one that can offer both the opportunity
to make a total revolution, and the courage to seize it, to those who
today make their revolutions only by halves: the middle-aged adulterers
and teenage elopers, the bank robbers and shoplifters, the Peace Corps
volunteers and block-burning rioters, religious mystics and hikers of
the Appalachian Trail, militiamen and members of Alcoholics Anonymous,
free software advocates and fired construction workers, and everyone else
who has everything at stake in the formation of a new world and no idea
how to get there. A radicalism that can join the cause of the landless
farmworkers in Brazil to the raw fury of the dilettante anarchist vandal
of the West, without any implications of charity work or youth reform;
one that can demand that we surpass the oppressive role of art in this
society, without denying or demeaning the solace the solitary adolescent
poet finds in it. One that can give real form to the false promises of
adventure implicit in &#147;rebellious&#148; rock music and fashion. .
. one that can integrate the needs of the violent young hoodlum with those
of the single mother, the art-school intellectual, and the runaway child.
One that can integrate the &#147;violent&#148; with the &#147;non-violent&#148;
resistance, showing that this is a false dichotomy, just like the self/other
dichotomy&#151;and every other dichotomy.</p>

<p><b>Figure A:</b> My mother started smoking when she was thirteen. She
calculated that she&#146;s probably spent enough money on cigarettes to
retire early, if she had it back; but instead, we grew up with billboards
advertising cigarettes next to our school, and now my brother smokes too.
It&#146;s finally illegal for them to advertise cigarettes on billboards,
so the same corporation has invested in other products, and other billboards.

<p><b>Figure B: </b>None of us ever got to know my grandfather&#151;he was
always so tired when he came back from work that he didn&#146;t talk.
When he retired last year, his employer gave him a watch. We still don&#146;t
know him. . . I guess at this point all he knows how to do besides work
is watch football on the television, and drink.

<p><b>Figure C: </b>Two nights ago, my friend was raped at knifepoint by
a boy who asked for a ride at a party. She had been one of the only women
I know who hadn&#146;t been raped or sexually abused yet. It&#146;s very
hard for me to let anyone touch me anymore. </p>
<p><b>Figure D: </b>My uncle became addicted to heroin after he was drafted
to serve in Vietnam. He finally fought free of the addiction, but now
he&#146;s dying of Hepatitis B.
</p>
<p><b>Figure E: </b>My lover was making puppets for street demonstrations
when the F.B.I. and police stormed her building on a fabricated excuse.
They teargassed everyone at the door, and began attacking people at random
as they destroyed all the puppets (which the papers would later refer
to as &#147;weapons&#148;). When she tried to get between her friend and
the policeman who was beating her with his nightstick, she was beaten
