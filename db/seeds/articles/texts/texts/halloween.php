<h1>Every
Night a Halloween!</h1>
<p> &quot;Fuck
you George&#8212;this one's for my brother!&quot; The war cry
came from a stocky gentleman in a leprechaun suit whose
uplifted elbow was headed straight for the president's eye.
Bush and the leprechaun toppled over into a messy heap on
the asphalt. We helped the two of them up and the leprechaun
stumbled away. I had just barely gotten the Commander in
Chief of the US military dusted off when another brutal
blow, this time a crushing uppercut, came out of nowhere
and sent the president's rubber face sailing out over the
crowd. The megaphone squealed and Larry's voice boomed out,
&quot;Ooooooooo that one had to hurt ladies and gentlemen!
Now whooooo's next?&quot; Meanwhile, Sarah had run off into
a little cluster of sumo wrestlers to fetch the weary face
of the 43rd president of the United States of America. It
was the fight of the decade! It's always a shame to have
such a top billing performance to offer but not know how
to gather the crowd of thousands it deserves. But never
fear! As luck would have it Chapel Hill, North Carolina's
famous Halloween carnival handled all the logistics for
us. Viola, there they were, 75,000 excited people ready
for a wild night. And hell, we've all been to enough of
these things to know how predictable they really are: supermans
by the dozen, way too many cross-dressing frat boys, fairies,
fairies, fairies, and that guy who just runs around screaming
&quot;wooooo!&quot; The scene was set for something, anything
to go down.</p>
<p> That's
where George came in&#8212;and he arrived in style, hanging on
the end of a rope, attended by a parade of drummers, banner-bearers,
stilt walking capitalist puppeteers and their corporate
marionettes, and, of course, the &quot;press.&quot; Our
effigy had a foam rubber head stuffed into a stretchy Bush
mask. He wore a dumpstered business suit (public figures
sometimes dress down for the masses) and a pair of red boxing
gloves. One of our number came in a tux with a bull horn.
He was the ringside announcer: &quot;You, yes you can PUNCH
the president!&quot; &quot;He knows you eat tofu you spineless
liberal, and he's here to WHIP YOUR ASS!!!&quot; &quot;Texas,
Afghanistan, Iraq, now George Bush is here&#8212;Chapel Hill,
you're next!&quot; &quot;It's your turn to take a swing
at the king!&quot; and so on like that.</p>
<p>
Actually, to our delight, we found that the crowd needed
very little encouragement. With a little coaching, meek
liberals would give a chuckle and a symbolic tap on the
nose. Other folks, most folks actually, took it to the prez
with vicious abandon. The tightly fitting mask was knocked
clean off the &quot;dummy&quot; too many times to count.
Over and over the &quot;puppet&quot; was ripped from our
hands by a hail of fists. When he crumbled on the ground,
the crowd would commence kicking and jumping on his body
as we are used to seeing cops do to the defenseless and
poor. Each individual's response to the situation seemed
to reflect the particular way she felt she suffered at the
hands of the regime: those who belong to the demoralized
and depressed middle classes tended to smack point and laugh;
those most likely to face imprisonment and state violence
were themselves ultraviolent.</p>
<p>
On the way to the event a taxi driver with limited English
pulled over just to give the commander and chief a tidy
thumping. The finale of the night was a flying elbow from
an imaginary third ring. It remains unclear to me how either
the dummy or the gleeful challenger walked away from that
blow. After three hours of continuous assaults our doll
was almost completely demolished. Hundreds had dealt blows.
Thousands, ourselves included, watched in astonishment at
the anger he inspired.</p>
<p> My
favorite aspect of the event was the humor and good cheer.
Watching the antics of the crowd, I hardly stopped laughing
for three hours straight. This atmosphere left little opportunity
for the few pro-Bush folks to try to do anything about the
ruckus. A couple troubled Republicans came up to the prez
and told him he was a &quot;good man,&quot; that they were
&quot;big supporters.&quot; Appropriately, Bush would respond
by socking them in the face! Such realism!</p>
<p>
Now let's get something straight for the record: we do not
suggest or condone engaging in fisticuffs with the president.
When dealing with the president, we strongly advise against
uppercuts, crushing rights, jabs, roundhouse kicks, knuckle
sandwiches, resounding smacks, boots in the ass or crotch
area, blows to the ribs or face, haymakers, hooks (left
or right), boxing of ears, or any combination of bonks,
jabs, thwacks, swats, or pokes. If you are concerned about
the world and want to secure power and effect change petty
roughhousing is simply unacceptable, not to mention illegal.
We recommend going through the established channels: for
example, being ultra-rich, or rigging elections, or allowing
airplanes to fly into buildings. However, as keen observers,
we feel that it is our patriotic duty to report that we
have witnessed in an overwhelming majority of our fellow
public holiday event-goers what could be construed as latent
feelings of violence, resentment, and readiness to brawl
directed at the president of the United States of America.</p>
