<h2 style="margin-top: 0px">The Discreet Charm of the</h2>
<h1>Bourgeoisie</h1>
<h2 style="margin-top: 0px">or, The Tyranny of the Hair Dryer</h2>
<h6>[adapted from George Orwell's Homage to Catatonia]</h6>
<p> Does your father drift from one hobby to another, fruitlessly seeking
a meaningful way to spend the little "leisure time" he gets off from work?
Does your mother endlessly redecorate the house, going from one room to
the next until she can start over at the beginning again? Do you agonize
constantly over your future, as if there was some kind of track laid out
ahead you&#151;and the world would end if you turned off of it? If the answer
to these questions is yes, it sounds like you're in the clutches of the
bourgeoisie, the last barbarians on earth. </p>
<h3>The Martial Law of Public Opinion</h3>
<p> Public opinion is an absolute value to the bourgeois man and woman because
they know they are living in a herd: a herd of scared animals, that will
turn on anyone it doesn't recognize as its own. They shiver in fear as
they ponder what "the neighbors" will think of their son's new hairstyle.
They plot ways to seem even more normal than their friends and coworkers.
They don't dare fail to turn on their lawn sprinklers or dress appropriately
for "casual Fridays" at the office. Anything that could drag them out
of their routines is viewed as suspect at best. Love and lust are both
diseases, possibly fatal, as are all the other passions that could drive
one to do things that would result in expulsion from the flock. Keep them
quarantined to secret affairs and teenage dates, to night clubs and strip
clubs&#151;for God's sake, don't contaminate the rest of us. Go wild when "your"
football team wins a game, drink yourself into oblivion when the weekend
comes, rent obscene movies if you have to, but don't you dare sing or
run or make love out here. Under no circumstances admit to feeling anything
that doesn't belong in the staff room or at the dinner party. Under no
conditions admit to wanting anything more or different than what "everyone
else" wants, whatever and whoever that might be. </p>
<p> And of course their children have learned this, too. Even after the
death matches of the grade school nightmare, even among the most rebellious
and radical of the nonconformists, the same rules are in place: don't
confuse anybody as to where you stand. Don't use the wrong signifiers
or subscribe to the wrong codes. Don't dance when you're supposed to be
posing, don't speak when you're supposed to be dancing, don't mess with
the genre or the moves. Make sure you have enough money to participate
in the various rituals. To keep your identity intact, make it clear which
subcultures and styles you're aligned to, which bands and fashions and
politics you want to be associated with. You wouldn't dare risk your identity,
would you? That's your character armor, your only protection against certain
death at the hands of your friends. Without an identity, without borders
to define the edges of your self, you'd just dissolve into the void . . .
wouldn't you? </p>
<h3>The Generation Gap</h3>
<p> The older generations of the bourgeoisie have nothing to offer the younger
ones because they have nothing in the first place. All their standards
are hollow, all of their riches are consolation prizes, not one of their
values contains any reference to real joy or fulfillment. Their children
sense this, and rebel accordingly, whenever they can get away with it.
The ones that don't have already been beaten into terrified submission.
</p>
<p> So how has bourgeois society continued to perpetuate itself through
so many generations? By absorbing this rebellion as a part of the natural
life cycle. Because every child rebels as soon as she is old enough to
have a sense of self at all, this rebellion is presented as an integral
part of adolescence&#151;and thus the woman who wants to continue her rebellion
into adulthood is made to feel that she is insisting on remaining a child
forever. It's worth pointing out that a brief survey of other cultures
and peoples will reveal that this "adolescent rebellion" is not inevitable
or "natural." </p>
<p> This perpetual rebellion of the youth also creates deep gulfs between
different generations of the bourgeoisie, which play a crucial role in
maintaining the existence of the bourgeoisie as such. Because the adults
always seem to be the enforcers of the status quo, and the youth do not
have the perspective yet to see that their rebellion has also been absorbed
into that status quo, generation after generation of young people are
able to make the mistake of identifying older people themselves as the
source of their misfortunes rather than realizing that these misfortunes
are the result of a larger system of misery. They grow older and become
bourgeois adults themselves, unable to recognize that they are merely
replacing their former enemies, and still unable to bridge the so-called
generation gap to learn from people of other age groups... let alone establish
some kind of unified resistance with them. Thus the different generations
of the bourgeoisie, while seemingly fighting amongst themselves, work
together harmoniously as components of the larger social machine to ensure
maximum alienation for all. </p>
<h3>The Myth of the Mainstream</h3>
<p> The bourgeois man depends upon the existence of a mythical mainstream
to justify his way of life. He needs this mainstream because his social
instincts are skewed in the same way his conception of democracy is: he
thinks that whatever the majority is, wants, does, must be right. Nothing
could be more terrifying to him than this new development, which he is
beginning to sense today: that there no longer is a majority, if there
ever was. </p>
<p> Our society is so fragmented, so diverse, that at this point it is absurd
to speak of a "mainstream." This is a myth partly created by the anonymity
of our cities. Almost everyone one passes on the street is a stranger:
one mentally relegates these anonymous figures to the faceless mass one
calls the mainstream, to which one attributes whatever properties one
thinks of strangers as possessing (for the smug salesman, they all envy
him for being even more respectable than they are; for the insecure bohemian
rebel, they must disapprove of him for not being like they all are). They
must be part of the silent majority, that invisible force that makes everything
the way it is; one assumes that they are the same "normal people" seen
in television commercials. But the fact is, of course, that those commercials
refer to an unattainable ideal, in order to keep everyone feeling left
out and insufficient. The "mainstream" is analogous to this ideal, as
it keeps everyone in line without ever actually making an appearance,
and possesses the same degree of reality as the perfect family in the
toothpaste advertisement. </p>
<p> No one worries more about this absent mass than the bohemian children
of the bourgeoisie. They bicker over how to orchestrate their protests
to gain "mass appeal" for their radical ideas, as if there still was a
mass to appeal to! Their society is now made up of many communities, and
the only question is which communities they should approach... and dressing
"nice," proper language and all, is probably not the best way to appeal
to the most potentially revolutionary elements of their society. In the
last analysis, the so-called "mainstream" audience most of them imagine
they are dressing up for at their demonstrations and political events
is probably just the spectre of their bourgeois parents, engraved deep
in their collective subconscious as a symbol of the adolescent insecurity
and guilt they never got over. They would do better to cut their ties
to the bourgeoisie entirely by feeling free to act, look, and speak in
whatever ways are pleasurable, no matter who is watching&#151;even when they
are trying to advance some political cause: for no political objective
reached by activists in camouflage could be more important than beginning
the struggle towards a world in which people will not have to disguise
themselves to be taken seriously. </p>
<p> This is not to pardon those insecure bohemians who use their activism
not as a means of building ties with others, but rather as a way to set
themselves apart: in their desperation to purchase an identity for themselves,
they believe they must pay for it by defining themselves against others.
You can recognize them by their self-righteousness, their pompous show
of ideological certainty, the ostentatious way they declare themselves
"activists" at every opportunity. Political "activism" is almost exclusively
their sphere, today, and "exclusive" is the key word... until this changes,
the world will not. </p>
<h3>Marriage . . . and Other Substitutes for Love and Community</h3>
<p> Reproduction is a big issue for the bourgeois man and woman. They can
only have children under very precise circumstances; anything else is
"irresponsible," "unwise," "a poor decision for the future." They must
be prepared to give up every last vestige of their youthful, selfish freedom
to have children, for the mobility their corporations demand and the strain
of vicious competition have destroyed the community network that long
ago used to share the labor of child-rearing. Now every family unit is
a tiny military outpost, closed and locked to the outside world both in
their hearts and in the paranoia-turned-city-planning of their suburbs,
each one an isolated emotional economy to itself where scarcity is the
key word. The father and mother must abandon their selves for the prescribed
roles of care-giver and bread-winner, for in the bourgeois world there
is no other way to provide for the child. Thus the bourgeois couple's
own fertility has been made a threat to their freedom, and a natural part
of human life has become a social control mechanism. </p>
<p> Marriage and the "nuclear family" (the atomized family?) as chain gang
have survived as a result of this calamity, much to the misfortune of
potential lovers everywhere. For as the young adventurer, who keeps her
lusts strong and her appetite whetted with constant danger and solitude,
knows well, love and sexual desire cannot survive overexposure&#151;especially
in the dull and lifeless settings that most married partners share time.
The bourgeois husband sees the only lover he is permitted under only the
worst possible circumstances: after every other force in his world has
had the chance to exhaust and infuriate him for the day. The bourgeois
wife learns to punish and ignore as "unrealistic" and "impractical" her
every desire for romance, spontaneity, wonder. Together, they live in
a hell of unfulfillment. What they need is a real community of caring
people around them, so parenthood would not force them into unwanted "respectability,"
so they would still be free to have the individual adventures they need
to keep their time together sweet, so they would never find themselves
so lost and desperately lonely. </p>
<p> In just the same way, their steady supply of food, of conveniences,
comforts, and diversions avail them not. For as every hitchhiker, every
hero, every terrorist knows, these things gain their value through their
absence, and can offer real joy only as luxuries happened upon in the
pursuit of something greater. Constant access to sex, food, warmth, and
shelter desensitize a man to the very pleasures they afford. The bourgeois
man has given up his chance to pursue real stakes in life for the assurance
that he will have these amenities and securities; but without real stakes
in his life, these can offer him no more real joy than the company of
his fellow prisoners. </p>
<h3>The Joys of Surrogate Living!</h3>
<p> You can take a quick tour of all the unacted desires of the bourgeois
man just by turning on his television or stepping into one of his movie
theaters. He spends as much of his time as he can in these various virtual
realities because he instinctively feels that they can offer him more
excitement and satisfaction than the real world. The saddest part is that,
so long as he remains bourgeois, this may actually be true. And as long
as he accepts the displacement of his desires into the marketplace by
paying for imitations of their fulfillment, he will be trapped in the
empty role that is himself. </p>
<p> These desires are not always pretty to see played out in Technicolor
and SurroundSound: the bourgeois man's dreams and appetites are as infected
by the fetishization of power and control as his society is. The closest
he seems to be able to offer to an expression of free, liberated desire
is the fantasy of all-consuming destruction that appears again and again
at the black heart of his wildest cinematic fever dreams. This makes sense
enough&#151;after all, in a world of nothing but strip malls and theme parks,
what honest thing is there to do but destroy? </p>
<p> The bourgeois man is not equipped to view his desires as anything but
unfortunate weaknesses to be fended off with placebos because his life
has never been about the pursuit of pleasure&#151;he has spent several centuries
achieving higher and higher standards of survival at the cost of everything
else. Tonight he sits in his living room surrounded by computers, can
openers, radar detectors, home entertainment systems, novelty ties, microwave
dinners, and cellular phones, with no idea what went wrong. </p>
<p> The bourgeois man is only possible by virtue of the blinders he wears
that prevent him from imagining that any other way of life is possible.
As far as he can tell, everyone from the impoverished migrant workers
of his own nation to the monks of Tibet would be bourgeois too, if only
they could afford it. He does his damnedest to maintain these illusions;
without them, he would have to face the fact that he has thrown his life
away for nothing. </p>
<p> The bourgeois man is not an individual. He is not a real person (although
if he was, he would probably live in Connecticut). He is a cancer inside
all of us. He can now be cured. </p>
