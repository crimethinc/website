<h1>Selling Ourselves Out</h1>
<h5><i>(Why just "selling things" is <br />
inherently counter-revolutionary)</i></h5>
<p> Look at the hardcore community, from a distance&#151;what do you see? The
most visible signs of our existence, besides bands playing in basements
and rented out halls, are the 'zines and records we sell. And open up
almost any one of those 'zines, and you see advertisements for other 'zines,
other records, other products. In fact, aside from the advertisements,
what are most of our 'zines about? The record reviews, the 'zine reviews,
the top ten lists all deal with products to buy and sell. The photos of
hardcore bands hopping around and shouting invariably feature kids dressed
in certain styles (band shirts, tattoos, etc.), as if to indicate that
these fashions, which are not too cheap, are an intrinsic part of being
involved in hardcore. </p>
<p> And when you get more deeply involved in hardcore, you find that you
really do spend quite a bit of time buying and selling products. You start
going to more shows and buying the records and 'zines you hear about.
You buy some band shirts and maybe purchase some clothes, piercings, or
tattoos that are similar to the ones your friends in the hardcore community
have. You start a 'zine of your own, and have to worry about how to buy
the copies to make it, and&#151;how to sell it. You start a band, and worry
about making demos and selling them, about buying equipment and being
paid to play shows; you start a distribution, and worry about how to sell
all the things you order; you start a record label, and you worry about
selling records, buying advertising, selling more records, more and more
buying and selling. That seems to be one of the main themes of hardcore
today, if not the main theme: economics. One of the main things that identifies
a kid who is getting involved in hardcore is the records and 'zines he
buys; and the people who are more deeply involved usually spend even more
time thinking about economics&#151;worrying about money, about promoting their
products, about sales and profits, since most of the projects we undertake
in hardcore right now seem to be business enterprises. That's the problem:
most of the projects we undertake in the hardcore community right now
seem to be business enterprises. </p>
<p> Of course we have to sell things to be able to make them and share them
with each other at all, living as we do in a capitalist system where it's
difficult get anything for free. But if this is the case, we still should
be more aware of the effects of the ways we conduct business, and also
strive for alternatives so that we will not be limited to only one form
of interaction. And if we truly are interested in transforming our lives
in fundamental ways, rather than just going through the motions of being
another youth subculture, buying and selling products should play a much
smaller role in our community than it does. It should be extremely clear
from looking at the corporate exploitation of the hippy subculture, the
(pop) punk subculture, and a thousand other youth subcultures that any
community/subculture that focuses primarily on products and image is vulnerable
to being taken over by corporate interests. We can't beat "the Man" by
playing his own game. Besides, there are so many other kinds of interaction
that are worth trying, that might be better for all of us. </p>
<h3>SELLING THINGS IS NOT "PROGRESS"</h3>
<p> First of all, and most importantly, we must remember that by itself
selling things does not accomplish anything. Just because more kids bought
hardcore records this year than ever before does not mean that the ideas
on those hardcore records are going to affect more people in genuine ways.
In fact, some methods of promotion and distribution that work to increase
sales also work to distract attention (both the record label's attention
and the buyers' attention) from the ideas that are addressed on the record,
as we'll discuss below. </p>
<p> Buying and selling goods and services is the foundation of our economy
here in the U.S.A. and Europe, and consequently, it often seems to be
the central focus of our lives. We spend half of our waking hours and
most of our energy at our careers, and almost all the careers available
have to do with selling things or services, or promoting those sales,
etc. And where has that gotten us? The companies that sell the most useless
products, like Coca Cola, achieve the biggest sales, because they can
afford to spend the most money on advertising and promoting their pointless
product. A number of large corporations are destroying the environment
(McDonalds, Exxon, etc.) and animals (the meat and dairy industry), financing
oppression of human beings (Pepsi, etc.), promoting products that destroy
people (the tobacco industry, etc.), and mistreating or underpaying their
workers (Nike and almost every other corporation I can think of)&#151;all
in the name of profit, because profit is the most important goal in this
kind of economy. The corporations that will not sell things as ruthlessly
as the others, that will not stomp over anything in their path to increase
sales, die out, while the corporations that act with the least concern
for the world in their quest for sales come to dominate the economy (and
thus the world) when "selling things" is the main focus. The products
that cater to the lowest common denominator (bad television shows, silly
movies, etc.) achieve the widest sales in this system, and come to dominate
our lives. Because our society treats "selling things" as an end rather
than a means, we live in a world that is fucked up in a thousand different
ways. </p>
<p> Do we really want to mirror mainstream society in our own community
by concentrating on that same kind of economic interaction? It seems possible
that that system might have the same effects in hardcore that it does
in mainstream society, if we're not careful. That is to say&#151;the labels
and other hardcore businesses that have the least scruples, that care
the least about the value of their products and the effects of the ways
they sell their products, might come to have the most power and influence
in a scene where selling things is the main focus... because though other
labels might care more about the way they go about business, they won't
be able to compete with the marketing and business savvy of their ruthless,
heartless competitors. And then, though some kids who have come to be
concerned about issues like consumerism would choose to support the more
independent/not-profit-motivated labels, the labels that were the most
visible to the most people would be the ones who concentrated the most
on pure sales alone and thought little about anything else. </p>
<p> In fact, if you look at hardcore right now, it's not hard to see that
very thing happening. </p>
<h3>ADVERTISING</h3>
<p> When you sell things, it's necessary to let people know that that they
are available from you, and so advertising has become a fundamental part
of the way we do business today, both inside and outside of the hardcore
community. This affects us in a couple of ways. First of all, "lowest
common denominator" advertising, which de-emphasizes the important qualities
of the product (assuming that it has important qualities to begin with)
and can lead people to purchase things which are useless to them, usually
is more effective than truly informative advertising; you can imagine
what kinds of products and business practices this encourages. Second,
in a more subtle way, advertising in the hardcore community can actually
contribute to the feeling that just buying and selling things is accomplishing
something. </p>
<p> I. Most of the big corporations that use advertising to sell their products
don't give a fuck about their consumers. Sales and profit are their chief
motivations, so they will advertise their products in any way that will
sell them, whether it is in the best interest of the buyers to buy them
or not. Advertising of this kind boils down to low-level mind control:
companies pay advertising agents (psychologists!) to figure out which
images and rhetoric will sell a product most effectively. That's why car
commercials have beautiful (so-called beautiful) women in them; that's
why toothpaste commercials have meaningless statistics in them; that's
why advertisements for soda and jeans are filled with things that have
nothing at all to do with soda or jeans. These images, which have fucking
nothing to do with whether the product will be useful to an individual
viewing the advertisement, nevertheless make it more likely that the individual
will buy the product. If you give a fuck about people at all, you can
see how this kind of advertising is&#151;dare I use this term?&#151;unethical.
</p>
<p> And unfortunately, these ads really are the ones that sell products
the most effectively&#151;even in the hardcore scene, it seems. Look in any
hardcore magazine, and you see advertisements that have nothing to do
with the products they are selling. Instead of using the space to tell
you about the records that are for sale, what the music sounds like and
what the themes are, these advertisements feature some catchy slogan and/or
funny picture encouraging consumerism. A good example is a recent Trustkill
advertisement featuring a little girl kissing a little boy and saying
"My boyfriend bought me all the new releases on Trustkill!" That doesn't
really tell you much about the records, but it uses silliness to stick
in your head and maybe encourage you to buy Trustkill records&#151;I guess
the idea is that if you buy Trustkill records, you will instantly win
the heart of the girl next door... just like the idea implicit in the
car commercials featuring beautiful women is that buying a car will make
you attract women (the image suggests that a pretty woman "comes with
the car"). I hate to pick on a friend, but another good example is the
latest Edison advertisement, which proclaims "the Grace of Brutality"
across a photograph of crying Vietnamese children who have just had their
clothes burned off by American napalm&#151;that's fucking tasteless, using
images of real human suffering inflicted by the last generation of American
men just to sell the music made by their sons. It would make sense if
any of the records being advertised actually addressed the issue of the
Vietnam war, but they don't; instead they're just described as having
"evil metallic riffing," etc. </p>
<p> This is not to say that anyone is completely innocent of using image
at the expense of content in advertisements. Right now, you have to, to
get anyone's attention. But if kids would pay more attention to what an
advertisement says, rather than how cute or fancy it is, and advertisers
would make an effort to print ad's that would honestly inform people about
the records without just trying to sell them at any cost, we could get
away from some of the more negative qualities of advertising. There's
just something stomach-turning about opening a hardcore magazine that
is supposed to talk about changing the world, doing something positive
with our lives, etc. and seeing nothing but record companies shouting
"BUY OUR STUFF!!" at the top of their lungs. If you give a fuck about
us, use your ad to tell us why we might want to buy it, rather than just
trying to manipulate us. </p>
<h4>II. But there's another issue to consider in our advertising
as well.</h4>
<p> The way these corporate-style psychological advertisements work is by
selling images. For example: a soap commercial features an attractive
mother cleaning her sweet, well-behaved children's clothes, while her
handsome husband relaxes in the background. This ad isn't so much selling
soap as it is selling the image of the "perfect American family"&#151;that's
why the soap itself isn't discussed at all. The silent suggestion is that
if you buy the soap, it will bring with it the status of having a perfect
family and a perfect household. This sounds sort of far-fetched, but it
really works; otherwise the thousands and thousands of advertising agents
across the U.S. and Europe would not use this technique over and over
to get people to buy their products. Of course the truth is that when
you buy the soap, you just get soap&#151;a perfect family life is not included
with it after all. But the suggestion still works to keep you buying it.
</p>
<p> A similar effect can take place in hardcore advertisements that, like
the ones CrimethInc. sometimes makes, tout how "revolutionary" the products
being sold are. These advertisements can sometimes work the way the soap
advertisement I just described works: they can create the impression that
by buying the record or 'zine, the revolution will come with it, when
that is simply not the case. Worse than that, when they are used to advertise
records revolutionary thinking and slogans become just another marketing
tool to encourage kids to buy things rather than to actually cause change.
"Smash the State," which used to mean "vigorously strive to overthrow
the government and the oppressive power structures built into our modern
society," now comes to mean "buy the new record by Chokehold!" Thus what
was once a desire for real revolution is subverted into a motivation for
consuming products and keeping the wheels of the present system turning.
To sum up: Are you using your band to "sell" revolution, or are you using
"revolution" to sell your band? </p>
<p> In regards to this problem, it's up to the buyer to remember that just
buying a hardcore record or political pamphlet, etc. is not, by itself,
going to accomplish anything. That's common sense, but advertising can
sometimes obscure the issue. And it is up to the labels to resist the
temptation to make advertisements that seem to suggest that buying their
records will accomplish anything by itself. Labels should make sure that
it is clear in their advertisements that they are only selling tools for
revolution, not revolution itself. </p>
<h3>HOW BUYING THINGS AFFECTS THE BUYER</h3>
<p> Besides the pitfalls of advertising, there are other possible drawbacks
to selling things in the hardcore community. One of the biggest of those
is that the money to buy them has to come from somewhere. The more records,
'zines, band shirts, etc. a hardcore kid buys, the more money he needs
to buy them. And not everyone can live off of a distribution/label/tattoo
parlor, you know. So the more records kids buy, the more money they have
to earn&#151;the more they have to work for some employer to earn the money!
Elsewhere in this issue and the last one, the unpleasant qualities of
modern day employment are discussed. That's not something we want to encourage.
</p>
<p> Because it's not even like kids are buying hardcore records instead
of the usual products from objectionable corporations. In the hardcore
community, we sell luxuries, not necessities. No matter how many records,
'zines, band shirts, etc. you purchase, you still have to pay for food,
for rent, for health care. So our countercultural businesses only contribute
to the problem of people having to work jobs they don't like, by making
it necessary that they earn more money to pay for our hardcore products
as well as everything else. And no matter how independent and D.I.Y. our
labels are, they still aren't actually fighting against big business,
because those big businesses have a complete monopoly on the goods and
services we need to survive. It doesn't matter much whether your CD has
a bar code on it when your food, your rent, your every other need is supplied
by the companies that use bar codes on CD's. </p>
<p> So selling things like records and 'zines, at least right now, helps
to perpetuate the status quo in which everyone has to work at jobs they
wish they could quit. This is not to say that it's not worth doing, if
the value of the records and 'zines outweighs their negative effects on
people's lives. But it's worth keeping in mind. It might be more worth
doing to try to figure out a way to liberate ourselves permanently from
the employment system, rather than spending our energy on selling luxuries
like records while most of our lives must still revolve around wasted
time and wasted potential... </p>
<h3>HOW SELLING THINGS AFFECTS THE SELLER</h3>
<p> When you have to concentrate on selling things, as anyone working within
the confines of today's exchange economy must, it's easy to get caught
up in it and forget about whatever other goals you started with. In order
to function at all in spreading your releases, no matter how good your
intentions are, you have to worry about being at least profitable to survive&#151;and
thus, to some degree, you have to worry about making the things that you
sell marketable. The ones who are willing to compromise more to make their
products sell better usually do end up selling them more effectively,
so the products that reach the most people are often the ones that are
the most watered-down, the least genuine. </p>
<p> You must compete for sales with others who may have the same goals as
you, which can create unnecessary animosity, and makes people work against
each other (just to survive and keep functioning) rather than together,
which might be more effective in accomplishing things. This competition
makes you have to think about selling competitively, and it becomes easy
to associate increased sales with making progress, when in truth the things
you have to do to attain these sales increases may work against the goals
you originally started with. </p>
<p> If you started out selling things to try to spread ideas of some kind,
you find that you have much less time to think about the ideas, to talk
about them with others, to work on nourishing their development. Instead,
you have to always be working on practical concerns. There's no time for
reading books, because you have to answer mailorders or buy advertisements.
You spend more time arguing with distributors than you do brainstorming
with others who might have valuable ideas to contribute. Pretty soon sales
are all you think about, all you have time to think about, and it becomes
hard to stay focused on your original goals, or even to really remember
them, through the haze of practical business concerns. </p>
<p> And that is why there are so many businesses in the hardcore community
that started out with good intentions and were completely transformed
by the years of competition and worrying about sales. Now many of them
care about nothing but making money, at any cost. Selling things can do
that to you&#151;it can strip away all your ideals and dreams, until you can
only focus on profit. And those who focus only on selling things for profit
will never be able to change anything for the better in this world. </p>
<h3>OTHER CONCERNS</h3>
<p> Some people think that the problems that an exchange economy (an economy
which revolves around buying and selling things) creates for human beings
are insoluble inside of such a system. This analysis suggests that as
long as people only have access to the goods and services that they can
trade their own goods and services for, human beings will always be in
danger of being forced to spend their lives doing things they don't enjoy
or care about in order to have the resources they need to survive. The
thinkers who consider this flaw to be intrinsic to the exchange economy
suggest instead a "gift economy," where things are shared rather than
exchanged. </p>
<p> This aspect of this discussion is really complicated, and cannot be
treated in detail here. If you are interested in it, an in-depth consideration
of the "exchange economy" versus the "gift economy" is scheduled to appear
in the second issue of Harbinger, a free CrimethInc. propaganda tabloid,
in December of this year. [If you want one, just write any of the CrimethInc.
addresses and ask for one&#151;the most dependable one is still probably the
Atlanta address] </p>
<h3>TO CONCLUDE: TWO SUGGESTIONS</h3>
<p> First of all, we should consider all the other things there are we can
do together in hardcore besides just imitating the businessmen of mainstream
society by selling each other things. Despite its silly name, Food Not
Bombs, which I mention elsewhere in this issue, is a great example of
a way people in the hardcore community can work together in ways that
are positive and productive for everyone. If you want to be active and
involved in hardcore, there are a million different things (more useful
things?) you can do besides starting a label, or writing a 'zine, or working
on something else you have to worry about selling. You could organize
fliering/propaganda troops, political action groups, sports or exercise
groups, book reading clubs, self-defense (anti-police) vigilante squads,
try starting a squat, arrange a hostel space for traveling bands and punk
rockers, write articles for other people's magazines, try new mediums
of expression (artwork, etc.). Of course, in order to have time and resources
to work on projects that you don't earn money from, you'll need a supportive
community around you, but that topic is addressed elsewhere in this issue.
Similarly, rather than just buying records, there are a million other
things that a person who has only been involved in hardcore punk for a
little while can do to participate. Corresponding with hardcore punk kids
from far away is already common, and offers a lot of possibilities. Make
mix tapes for each other. Come up with your own creative fashions, that
you can wear cheaply or free, rather than paying for overpriced styles
that have already been prefabricated for you. Break into abandoned buildings
and go exploring, organize a walkout from your school or workplace, hitchhike
around the world, sit up late at night trading stories and arguing about
stupid Inside Front articles, go crazy. After you've broken out of traditional
patterns of action and interaction, the sky's the limit. </p>
<p> And, second, we should certainly not give up on selling things like
records and 'zines that cost money to make. Until some hardcore punk commando
unit seizes a record pressing plant and starts making vinyl for free,
we have to finance those records somehow. But we should always keep in
mind the limitations of selling and advertising things&#151;that these activities
by themselves won't accomplish anything. We can buy and sell things without
betraying ourselves, if we stay focused on our real goals. But in order
to do this, we must be aware of the ways that selling and advertising
things can compromise the power and quality of the things being sold&#151;and
even of the people being sold to. In this article I tried to describe
some of those dangers, but each of us should think about the topic individually.
</p>
<p> Last March, while my band was in the studio, I made some notes on the
back of a lyric sheet for a "footnote" I'd like to put in every advertisement
for CrimethInc. records: </p>
<p> Please do not buy this product because it looks attractive or because
all your friends have one. For your sake, don't waste your money on it
unless you know what it is you're purchasing and think that it really
might be useful or meaningful to you. Please do not think that merely
purchasing this product is going to do anything to change the world, or
to improve your life or anyone else's. Right now, we can't effectively
distribute these ideas and music without selling them, but just selling
them is not our goal; it is only a means to an end. We try to sell these
records in a way that does not compromise the power of their content&#151;we
want to sell them like we would sell any other kind of weapon against
the status quo, with the emphasis upon their usefulness in making people
feel alive and aware, making people dangerous.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<h5><i>You should
buy a CrimethInc. product like you would buy a bomb&#151;to use it, dangerously!</i></h5>
<h6>Endnote: This article is not a criticism of anyone
in particular so much as it is a self-criticism of the hard core community
in general. Of course Inside Front partakes in the same things we are
criticizing here as much as everyone else does&#151;we're NOT claiming innocence,
but we are suggesting that we should all consider this issue and perhaps
try to move forward. </h6>
