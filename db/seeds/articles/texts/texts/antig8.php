<h5>Crimepens&eacute;e Eyewitness Account
of the<br />
Anti-G8 Demonstrations and Anarchy in the Alps</h5>
<p>After
hours of being herded into airports, terrorized by border
guards, and adjusting my disguise as a harmless pony-tailed
animation artist, I arrived at Annemasse. I felt like somewhere
there should be trumpets, a glorious symphony announcing
that against all odds this convicted criminal had made in
past border-guards and hitch-hiked without knowing a word
of French to a tiny little village in the Alps which served
as our secret anarchist headquarters.. As travel companions
I was with an Italian philosopher and an Estonian film student
(who we had picked up at the airport because &#8220;We looked
interesting&#8221;) and in my pockets only a few pennies.
Yet, within only one day we were going to take on the eight
largest powers on the face of the earth. </p>
<p>I
was a bit surprised when walking into the <a href="#vaaag">VAAAG</a>
that it appeared to be some sort of vaguely anarchist Woodstock.
And a bad corporate one, with high-priced beer and no free
food in sight. Clearly, something was wrong. I hurriedly
borrowed the mobiles of strangers to call the crimepens&eacute;e
agent I had e-mailed only a few hours before he himself
had begun his own wild hitch-hike to the VAAAG. Within a
few hours of tramping about looking for him, it became clear&#8212;I
wasn&#8217;t even at the anarchist camp! I was at the camp
of the Intergalactic, the camp of the social democrats,
hippies, and Trotskyists. Of course there was going to be
bad reggae and overpriced beer! Yet, on the other side of
the mobile, I could hear the unmistakable sound of punk
rock, and I could already smell the free food! </p>
<p>Despite
it being pitch-black, I saw from the torch-lights of the
VAAAG a tall man who was unmistakably sporting the infamous
logo of the international conspiracy only known as the CrimethInc
Ex-Workers Collective. I hurried over and introduced myself,
and thanks to his perfect grasp of English within a few
minutes we had a mad-cap plan of crossing the border to
aid blockades at Lausanne, a smaller Swiss town that the
G8 delegates were going to ride through early Sunday morning
in an attempt to avoid the roads near Geneva and Annemasse,
towns already occupied by hordes of anarchists. Again another
international border and a lack of Swiss Francs to pay for
transport could be difficulties, but such things had never
stopped us before. The forces of anarchy, separated by continents
and border-guards, had just begun to gather their powers.
</p><p>The
Crimepens&eacute;e agent informed me politely that he was
going to sleep with a young woman, thus making my presence
inside her tent a bit strange, but that I was welcome to
sleep right outside. After having a few free cups of tea,
I gathered my things to go to the bed. Luckily, a woman
the age of my mother came up to me and in French informed
me that autonomy included doing the dishes. I thanked her
and started cleaning the tables. <br>
At the next morning assembly at VAAAG, about two hundred
rag-tag anarchists of over a dozen different nationalities
decided it was time to leave France and go to Lausanne,
consequences be damned! We marched like a small army straight
to the border between France and Switzerland, where an emergency
consensus meeting took place over whether or not we were
going to show our papers to the border-guards. While at
first it seemed to make sense, a young woman in our group
revealed that she was already barred from entering Switzerland,
so if we showed our papers she couldn&#8217;t go through.
Our group decided on solidarity, that none of us were going
to show our papers&#8212;and if the guards wanted them,
they would have to answer to all of us! I was a bit incredulous,
having been involved in at least one failed border-opening
before and ever being the pessimist, I asked them if they
had ever blockaded a border before and if they even knew
how to blockade a street. They just smiled and said they
would worry about such things when they happened. Lacking
their faith, the Crimepens&eacute;e agent and myself marched
towards the front of the group and prepared for the worst.
The horde of anarchists behind us began chanting &#8220;No
Borders, No Nations, Stop Deportations!&#8221;...and marched
right past the dozen stunned Swiss border guards, who stared
at us in disbelief. Our international gang reformed after
its first victory, and came to the conclusion that now in
Switzerland we had to get to Lausanne as quickly as possible
before the authorities clamped down on our blatant disregard
for international migration laws. We would . . . take the
tram!</p>
<p>Within
minutes a tram pulled up next to the border, and two hundred
anarchists filled in completely. I began wondering why we
didn&#8217;t do these types of seizures of public transportation
more often. Everyone was smiling, clapping, and soon declared
our solidarity to make sure we all paid our tram tickets&#8212;after
we were dead. The seizures of public transportation continued
unabated at the train station. Within minutes we had figured
out what train was going to Lausanne, and using my body
to keep the doors open, began piling in. A nervous conductor
came up to the Crimepens&eacute;e agent and explained that
another train was leaving in ten minutes and would get us
to Lausanne even quicker than this train. He smiled at her,
thanking her for the advice, but informed her that we were
sensibly taking the train that was leaving right now. All
aboard the Anarchy Express!</p><p>Through
the windows, the Alps and the perfect blue lake of L&eacute;man
sped by us. Overflowing from the seats, our crew sat on
our backpacks and chatted excitedly with the locals who
had made the unfortunate decision to actually pay for the
train to Lausanne. At Lausanne we were greeted at the train-station
by a man&#8212;who could in another life pass for a mild-mannered
barber&#8212; that announced in a few minutes we would have
a bus headed towards the anarchist base of Camp Bourdonette.
We arrived at a camp that was well-organized with hot-showers,
melted Swiss chocolate bars, and a plethora of black and
red flags. After claiming a bit of ground for Crimepens&eacute;e,
we decided to head to the squatted Camp Oulalala by the
lake for a swim to cool-off after a long day of not paying
for any form of public transportation whatsoever.</p><p>Where
we greeted by a giant international anarchist beach party!
I had never seen anything quite like this in my life: the
amassed forces of the anti-globalization movement sunbathing,
giving out heaps of free salad, throwing Frisbees nude in
the lake, and generally having the time of their lives.
After stripping off my clothes and jumping in the lake,
I swam to what I can only describe as a ricketedy pirate
raft built to single-handedly intercept the G8 delegates
who, too terrified of the protesters to drive to Evian,
were going to be boated across the lake. Complimenting the
German crew on their flying the Jolly Roger, I climbed in
and asked if they really intended to use this raft to intercept
the G8 delegates and what they would do with them if they
actually caught them. Although my German is notoriously
poor, I believe they told me that they would make the heads
of the eight largest powers in the world walk the plank.
</p><p>As
night set in, the discussion got more serious. Somehow having
found myself in the camp of Germans and German-speaking
Swiss, the camp starting a very serious discussion about
how many roads in Lausanne we were going to block and how
we were going to do it. While all the details were kept
suitably mysterious, the organizers assured us that &#8220;We
know how to block roads&#8221; and that &#8220;Supplies
had been prepared&#8221;. After deciding to stick together,
the Franco-Germanic Bloc sent a delegate down to the Pink
and Silver Bloc (which liked dressing up in outrageous pink
and silver outfits and dancing to the latest in anti-capitalist
samba music). At the inter-group meeting, it was decided
that the Samba band would lead the march into Lausanne,
and a spokesman from &#8220;the Dark Grey Bloc&#8221; announced
that &#8220;we embraced heterogeneity and dancing, and no-one
was going to be forced to commit acts of violence they don&#8217;t
approve of. &#8221;. Hundreds of people clapped and cheered.
It was going to be one of those days&#8230;tomorrow morning,
that is. As I went to sleep, the last thing I remember hearing
was the sound of a radio playing, &#8220;I am the antichrist,
I am an anarchist, I know what I want and I know how to
get it&#8230;&#8221;</p><p>Promptly
at six o&#8217;clock in the morning the teeming masses of
anarchy gathered outside their camp, with only a lone cop
on a motorcycle cowardly perched in the distance. As everyone
wiped their eyes, drank down some coffee, and checked their
pockets for their vinegar and onions (to defend against
the tear-gas attacks). Out of nowhere a ridiculously beaten-up
green van appeared that resembled something that an anarchist
Che Guevara would drive straight into the apocalypse. To
my surprise it began blasting an eclectic and tasteful mix
of everything from German streetpunk, techno, and hip-hop
through speakers mounted on its roof. This tasteful choice
in music got even my hips swaying in the morning sun, and
some sections of the Black Bloc started dancing. The music
was interrupted occasionally by news in both German and
English: &#8220;The roads have already been blocked in Geneva!&#8221;
Cheering broke loose, but we all realized we were running
behind schedule. Where was the Pink and Silver Bloc when
you needed them? Our mysterious radio host announced &#8220;The
Pink and Silver have lost their Samba band&#8230;if anyone
sees a Samba band, please tell them!&#8221; After a few
more minutes of frustration, from the distance the unmistakable
sound of Samba drums was heard. Triumphantly, we took over
the highway and without a cop is sight began marching straight
towards downtown Lausanne. </p><p>As
regards preparation, this Black Bloc had definitely done
their homework. Bottles of paint were distributed, blocks
of wood gathered in carts, and huge tripods were carried.
Indeed, the Bloc was ready for blockading. One Crimepens&eacute;e
agent was simply handed a pair of bolt-cutters with a wink!
Ever apt at improvisation, anarchists began splitting off
from the main march and seizing every available dumpster
(including those chained to the ground!) for use as blockades.
The Bloc, still on the outskirts of the city, began approaching
when a Crimepens&eacute;e Independent Revolutionary Cell
noticed a Shell petro station in the distance. Hoping that
everyone would get the message, he began yelling &#8220;Shell!
Shell! To hell with Shell!&#8221; Within seconds, members
of the Bloc started throwing stones and paint. The level
of struggle was raised when yet another Crimepens&eacute;e
agent, bolt-cutters in hand, aimed straight at the window!
Within a minute, some of the more enterprising members of
the Bloc also rushed at the windows and began smashing them
with their boots, iron bars, whatever was at hand. As the
corner was turned, an Esso appeared, and the Bloc began
reducing it to rumble as quickly as possible. The sound-van
reminded everyone not to spend all their time destroying
multi-nationals, but to remember that we were here to blockade
roads. Inside the Esso, the Bloc triumphantly seized everything
from cigarettes to flowers, destroying as much of the Shell
station as they could in the process. A few of the more
enterprising members of the Bloc even grabbed oil for lighting
future blockades on fire. The process continued like clockwork,
and a Select station around the corner was just asking for
it. </p><p>As
soon as we came to the first intersection to blockade, the
Black Bloc acted in a way that can only be considered professional.
Boards, crow-bars, and dumpsters were artfully assembled,
and as an artist would be a finishing touch on their masterpiece,
lit on fire. Several members of the Bloc stood back to admire
their handiwork, lighting their cigarettes on the burning
wreckage. Cars began backing up, and a few members of the
Bloc waved, and one driver actually waved back! The entire
main roundabout outside Lausanne was blocked! As the Black
Bloc continued its march straight into town, it didn&#8217;t
encounter any police resistance since the Pink and Silver
Bloc kept the police line confused with their antics and
music just a few hundred meters from where the Black Bloc
was setting up the blockades. As one intersection was entered,
the Black Bloc began skillfully disassembling entire construction
sites, using every available and imaginable part of the
construction equipment that could be possibly turned into
a barricade. A full-scale wooden fence appeared on one side
of the intersection, another began to be filled with dumpsters
and an iron bars. The Bloc in its excitement even began
blockading even the side of the street they came from, but
soon realized that they were blockading the escape route
as well, and then dismantled the blockade as quickly as
they put it up. Another overeager young member of the Bloc
smashed the window to a small shop, claiming in defense
that this shop primarily sold meat and so should be destroyed
in the name of animal liberation. A quick debate on the
merits of the action took place, and finally the group more
or less decided that the negative reaction from locals outweighed
the possible advantages. In the meantime, a Black Blocker
with a megaphone reminded the crowd that lighting fires
in residential neighborhoods might possibly burn down a
residence, so &#8220;Cool the flames, but not the enthusiasm&#8230;we
have all day!&#8221; The locals came out on their window
still and street corners, to view the passing spectacle.
Expecting probably nothing less than a horde of murderous
barbarians as advertised by the police and the media, the
locals were pleasantly surprised when the Black Bloc began
throwing packs of cigarettes onto the balconies into the
arms of surprised grandmothers, and giving brightly colored
flowers to shocked store clerks. Never has rioting been
so joyous! </p><p>Such
hours of insurrection are not to last forever, and if they
did perhaps we would forget their sweetness. Suddenly, from
the distance tear-gas could be smelled wafting into the
air. Screaming and running, a cross-dressing Italian in
a full pink skirt and silver wings announced that the Pink
and Silver Bloc was being attacked by the pigs and needed
help! </p>
<p> As the Black Bloc moved forward, the Pink and Silver Bloc
fell back even more, and despite the steady-stream of tear-gas
canisters falling around the unmistakable view of a giant
water cannon could be seen, ruthlessly spraying the Pink
and Silver Bloc. It was pure cowardice on the part of the
pigs to attack the Pink and Silver street party first&#8230;and
together, the Pink and Silver joined the Black Bloc to fight
back. While black-masked blockaders and pink fairies managed
to fight back by erected barricades from barbwire, burning
cardboard, and an over-turned wagon&#8212;buying the crowd
some needed breathing time&#8212;a tactical retreat was
in order. Unfortunately, the retreat was anything but tactical,
as a thoroughly mixed-up Black and Pink Bloc separated and
went down two separate streets. This was a clear recipe
for disaster, and within the hour the group our affinity
group was with was surrounded by cops who were clearly going
to close in within a few minutes. After a moment of quick
thinking, our affinity group de-blocked (which means simply
removing your black mask and replacing your monochrome outfit
with suitably middle-class apparel such as a button-downed
plaid shirt) and jumped a fence into a residential neighborhood.
This neighborhood was peaceful, and as our affinity group
crawled out of the well-manicured lawn, we surprised an
older man who was quietly walking his dog from a running
riot. Giving him a quick wink, we saw the other main split-off
group. Re-blocking, we desperately tried to convince them
that to rejoin the group that was surrounded by police just
surrounded by police just down the street, but our pleas
were ignored and following the usual and depressing herd
instinct of crowds, the group just began marching down the
nearest empty street. Obligingly, the cops followed and
as the crowd approached an open park, began openly pelting
people with tear-gas canisters and attacking the crowd with
truncheons. Seeing as the crowd had lost its earlier co-ordination
and morale, things were only going to go downhill&#8212;a
point proved as the crowd panicked again and started running
across the park to escape the tear-gas. Jumping in the middle
of yet another crowd of pink pixies in order to de-block,
our affinity group decided to call it a day in Lausanne
and walk back to camp to attempt to get whatever remained
of the demonstration to Geneva. As we walked back to camp,
we smiled as dumbfounded police and Shell employees began
picking through the smashed remains of their store. All&#8217;s
well that ends well&#8212;or at least ends with the capitalists
suffering at least as much as they make us suffer. </p>
<p>Back
at Camp Bourdonette, the main crowd was being herded down
the street by riot police, who in a move of unexpected chutzpah
blocked the crowd off from returning to Camp Oulalala by
the lake where the protesters had left their personal belongings.
The crowd, confused, meandered up the hill to Bourdonette
and the police followed, surrounding us in order not to
allow anyone to exit. My mind racing, it became apparent
that the cops were at best going to at least quarantine
us in this camp, and at worse come inside the camp and beat
the living daylights out of us. Thinking of School Diaz
in Genoa, our affinity group hurriedly gathered their things
and announced to other affinity groups that the time to
leave was now or never. Almost everyone else decided it
would be useful to wait to see what would happen, and perhaps
retrieve their possessions from Camp Oulalala by the lake.
We smiled, told everyone to meet us in Geneva, and made
a mad-cap dash across the street to some woods, where the
cops had yet to blockade. Manically rushing through underbrush,
we ended up in the parking lot of a graveyard, and peering
down the street, noticed that cops were already blocking
off the exit, but the pigs didn&#8217;t see us. </p>
<p>Some
of our erstwhile comrades panicked and fled into the graveyard,
but our affinity group kept a level head by asking a polite
old couple who were loading their van if they would be kind
enough to save our freedom from the encroaching police.
At first they seemed a bit surprised and maybe a little
bit scared too&#8230;we told them the police was attacking
the camp and that their ride was our only way out, our only
way to avoid jail, emphasizing the drama with wild gesticulations
and our eyes begging for help. Calmly, the old man stared
at us with a look of peace and answered quietly: &#8220;Okay . . .
Let&#8217;s go quick then&#8221;. We hid our backpacks in
the trunk, jumped in the suburban van and thanked them a
million times in a mixture of French and English. We were
still anxious that the police would stop the van (As for
the two of our crew fled into the graveyard&#8212;writing
this four days later we still don&#8217;t know if they&#8217;re
still hiding there!) but we couldn&#8217;t help but smile
as we the van sped past police lines without a problem.
Not only did they help us escape the police blockades, the
couple were actually going in the direction of Geneva: Wooo-hoo!
Inside the car, the radio blathered on about &#8220;a degenerating
riot of wild youth&#8221; in Lausanne, and we could barely
help ourselves from bursting out in laughter, leaving our
hosts perplexed. We started to talk with them about the
G8 and even those &#8220;not-so-nice kids breaking things
down&#8221;. We went to great pains to emphasize that all
that was broken, burnt, wrecked, and plundered belonged
to large multi-national corporations, and that if you take
into account all the damage and killings caused by their
neo-liberalism our strike back was not only minute, but
understandable. They seemed dubious, so we switched the
subject and talked about how violent the police were (which
was true on some level, but given our blockades and property
destruction not particularly surprising, but it&#8217;s
always important to give pigs a bad name!). We were driving
for maybe fifteen minutes when the old man told us he would
then take a secret countryside road as the police were controlling
the entry of all large towns. We thanked them again for
going out of their way, and one of out company muttered,
&#8220;Damn, it felt so good to be a gangster!&#8221; . . . and
even better to find local accomplices! The elderly couple
shook our hands, leaving us at the train station of a small
town ten minutes away from Geneva.</p>
<p>A
few minutes later we arrive at the Geneva station (without
paying for our train tickets!) and head towards the Indymedia
Center at &#8220;L&#8217;Usine&#8221;, hoping to meet friends
there and find out if there was any action still going on.
Once inside L&#8217;Usine, free beers and orange juice in
hand, we were told the camp in Lausanne had been attacked
by the police and that they arrested over 150 people more
or less at random, questioning them as regards property
destruction. Hundreds of others being held hostage without
the permission to leave the camp until they released their
papers to the pigs. After relaying our escape on the Indymedia
Radio, we decided it was time to take a well-deserved rest.
According to all the news &#8220;from the front&#8221; on
Indymedia, police repression was intensifying everywhere;
and with most of the demonstrations coming to an end, we
decided not to try out luck but to leave Switzerland as
soon as possible. </p>
<p>We
walked across all of Geneva under the bright sun, utterly
exhausted yet still on alert since hundreds of cops were
keeping anyone who looked like a protester under tight surveillance.
After a really long walk we arrived at a station where a
train was supposed to bring us back to Annemasse&#8230;but
due to the fucking demonstrations it was closed! One of
us noticed an Amnesty International van parked nearby so
we decided to beg for them to bring us to the border. They
were surprised to be interrupted from their note-taking,
as Amnesty International were there to document political
repression, but we managed to convince them that our affinity
group was likely going to be another victim of repression
itself for their files unless they got us across that border!
While they at first drug their feet and told us to wait
till nearly darkness, so that we should walk there instead;
ten kilometers by foot with heavy backpacks after a day
of riots, quick escapes, and sun burns: What a great idea,
Amnesty!! Fortunately a young woman finished her work for
the day and accepted to bring us back to the VAAAG in Annemasse.
We thanked this kind stranger a million times, even though
we all fell asleep in her car while she was still talking
to us. As she dropped us off in Annemasse, people ran up
to us and told us that just a few minutes ago the Indymedia
Centre in Geneva was attacked by the under-cover police,
who not only checked the papers of but violently beat many
media activists, arresting twelve under the auspices of
searching for the ever-elusive &#8220;Black Bloc&#8221;.
Luckily, by raiding a media center caught their under-handed
tactics live on camera! We felt horrible, but at the same
time breathed yet another sigh of relief for following our
trustworthy instincts. Yes, the G8 did manage to meet in
Evian, but we definitely gave them a taste of the hell their
political policies were inflicting on the rest of the world.
As our group of anarchist conspirators and criminals drifted
to sleep in this strange autonomous zone that had appeared
from out of nowhere, we could not help but to realize that
despite all their teargas, border-guards, water-cannons,
over-priced train tickets, and secret meetings we had these
presidents and premiers running scared. The amassed forces
of the world&#8217;s eight most powerful countries not only
failed to stop us, but couldn&#8217;t even catch us! And
there&#8217;s no sleep like the sleep of after a job&#8212;or
insurrection&#8212;well-done. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="vaaag" id="vaaag"></a>VAAAG:</h2>
<h3 style="padding-top: 0px">Village for Human and Anarchist Experimentation</h3>
<p>Although
the main demonstration (Where you can smash corporations
and burn capitalism down!) was on Sunday, we decided to
leave on Thursday as we had heard of some &#8220;anarchist
camp&#8221; taking place one week before the G8 summit.
So the three of us left the dirty industrial town of R----
and escaped to the green mountain retreat of the Alps. We
were definitely a strange crew: a half-mad Belgian hobo
(retired from a career as a punk rock star too!) and two
other hardcore kids trying to be a bit more punk. Amazingly,
all three of us together hitch-hiked the 700 km separating
us from our upcoming battle in a day, and in the process
had a really nice picnic with some old people we almost
converted to anti-capitalism. We arrived at the VAAAG (The
Alternative Anti-capitalist Anti-war Village) in the evening,
where we were welcomed at the entrance by young men who
explained us the way the village worked. The VAAAG consisted
of around 1500 people living&#8212;in the best possible
sense of the word&#8212; in one big field. The VAAAG was
composed of tents offering a vast array of activities such
as punk shows, debates, workshops on every imaginable issue,
video-showings, legal advice, medical assistance, a nursery,
an Indymedia Center, and more. The VAAAG itself was divided
into &#8220;barrios&#8221;, each barrio being grouped around
a communal kitchen. Every morning there was an assembly
in each barrio to figure out what was going great and what
should be improved. Two delegates of each barrio would meet
at noon with other delegates to share everyone&#8217;s ideas
and recommendations. If you didn&#8217;t feel at ease in
your barrios you could switch barrios at any time. As we
sat around a fire in front of which people were discussing,
singing, and playing guitar, and we went to the first kitchen
tent we found. The smell of awesome vegan food reminded
us of our empty stomachs. One of the members of the barrio
explained to us that the food was free, made by everyone
for everyone, but that a contribution would be great to
help paying for the camp fees. We gave a couple of euros
and had a marvellous time eating tons of pasta and sauce
around the fire. In the tradition of hobo elitism, we had
no tent so we just fell asleep on our sleeping bags outside.
The bright sun woke us up pretty early, and within minutes
we were in the middle of the morning assembly. We were surrounded
by a heterogeneous crowd of fifty people: young crusties,
old ladies, middle-aged hippies&#8230;.basically people
of all kinds. The assembly figured out who would take care
of the kitchen, the entrance, the camp security, and all
other pressing matters for the day. The discussion was rolling
from one person to another in a impressive and polite manner
(Although in the assembly next to us, these old anarchists
were all shouting at each other, which while sounding cool
and passionate, probably got less done!). Someone came up
with the idea of creating a team to clean up toilets and
the camp in general. At this point an elderly man raised
his voice for the first time, explaining that he thought
we should avoid this kind of specialization as it was everyone&#8217;s
duty to keep the camp clean, not a handful of unlucky volunteers!
After maybe an hour, we left the assembly and dispersed
into the camp. It was really amazing seeing anarchy in action.
In one corner of the village an old man was building a small
swimming pool for two little children out a mysterious giant
pipe, some strings, and a plastic container&#8230;and just
a few meters away some women was constructing a solar-heater
to have a hot shower. There were so many things going on
it was dazzling: constant debates and video showings, kids
running free without parental supervision, friends gathering
to peel vegetables and prepare food. Anarchy in fucking
action, dude. The only problem we encountered was a couple
of days later, when we had an assembly to decide what to
do concerning the 150 arrested demonstrators in Lausanne.
It was hard to find a consensus as we wanted to show authorities
we were in solidarity with them but didn&#8217;t want our
camp to fall to the same fate as the camps that morning
in Lausanne. There was actually no &#8220;right&#8221; choice,
so people had a hard time figuring this out. Finally, the
decision was that the people too tired to demonstrate again
would stay in the village to prevent a police attack while
others would assemble in front of the city hall in Annemasse
to offer food and talk to the locals, showing the town people
that these crazy anarchists were not just about smashing
windows but about building a better world as well. </p><p>
Sometimes, we&#8217;re so stuck in this world of shit we
find it hard to believe in anything. That makes communities
like the VAAAG all the more powerful as we realize anarchy
is not just a refusal of their system but a real convergence
of creative and unique desires, an army of diehard dreamers
bent on making those dreams reality and making reality our
dreams. </p>
<p> While only forty kilometers away from here in the VAAAG
the eight richest countries of the world were going to meet
in order to figure out how to go on fucking everyone, we
were there to show that something else was possible . . .
fuck, we showed anarchy fucking existed right here! </p>
