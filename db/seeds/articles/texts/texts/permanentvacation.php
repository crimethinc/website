<h1>How I Spent My  Permanent Vacation</h1>
<h6>by Brian D.</h6>
<p> More than what I eat, whether or not I use drugs, and what bands I go
to see, the bottom line for me as a member of the hardcore community and
the counterculture in general is this: stay unemployed. Do whatever it
takes, but keep my time and my labor to myself. I'm proud to say that
it's been over three years now since I worked at any job for someone else.
Here's why&#151;and how. </p>
<h3>WHY</h3>
<p> First of all, and most importantly, there just isn't any other feeling
that can compare with the sensation of complete freedom and self-determination.
I wake up in the morning, when I want to, and make plans to do things
that day&#151;to do what I want to. Nobody can buy a beautiful sunny day away
from me at seven dollars an hour. If I suddenly have a new inspiration
or idea, I can pursue it spontaneously without having to worry about how
it will reflect on my future employment. I'm free to suddenly go on tour
with my favorite band, to accidentally run into an old friend and spend
the day catching up on lost time, or to stay home all day and write the
first chapter of a novel if I am moved to. So my life contains a great
deal more diversity and spontaneous opportunity than it would otherwise.
And because I don't have to do the same thing over and over every day,
all day (for example, sell real estate, wait tables, or program computers),
I can do enough different things to keep everything fresh and exciting.
</p>
<p> And of course I do things! I don't just hang out or sit around&#151;I have
all the energy that would otherwise be drained from me at work free to
use on all the projects I care about. I can go to the library here (it's
only $10, for anyone, for a yearly membership at the university library
here&#151;that even includes their video and CD libraries) and read or watch
old movies, I can exercise, I can play music, write, do all sorts of creative,
self-improving, productive things. If I had been working the past three
years, it would have been impossible for me to have made Inside Front
what it is&#151;I wouldn't have had the time or energy to research and write
it, to organize and publish it, or to distribute it the way I have. The
same goes for Catharsis, the band I play in; the music we have made and
the experiences we have had traveling and performing mean more to me than
any amount of money ever could, and Catharsis has taken up a lot of time
that I wouldn't have had if I worked. The same goes for my involvement
in CrimethInc.&#151;because I don't sell my time to some office or business
establishment, I have time of my own to dedicate to helping bands that
I love get their music packaged the way it should be and available to
others. The same goes for my involvement in other projects&#151;writing for
other magazines and pamphlets, fliering, and being active in my community
in other ways. If I worked, even if it was at a job I liked (at a cafe
with a relaxed atmosphere, etc.), I might not be unhappy, but my life
certainly would not be as fulfilling as it has been with all of these
activities in it in place of traditional employment. </p>
<p> Better yet, I get to work on these things that I care about however
I see fit. I'm not following instructions, attempting to impress anyone
who will be evaluating me for a promotion, or working within the confines
of any restrictions on my efforts. I have completely free reign for my
creativity. I can decide for myself how and when I will be most productive,
rather than having to show up at work at 9 am every day whether that is
good for my concentration or not. Thus I can make myself more effective
and efficient than any boss ever could. </p>
<p> Finally, and most importantly, I'm voting both with my dollars and my
time and energy against the existing system. I don't approve of the way
most of my friends are treated in their places of employment; they usually
have to deal with overbearing or incompetent managers, their tasks are
often boring and repetitive, and they are typically not even given enough
money to be able to take care of all their needs (many of which needs&#151;nice
clothes, transportation, etc.&#151;are created by their jobs). I don't approve
of the way many corporations conduct business (i.e. mistreating and slaughtering
animals, destroying the environment, exploiting their workers, supporting
governments that oppress and exploit their citizens, making products that
are harmful to humans and the environment, etc.) and I also don't approve
of the way our economy functions (with so many companies being interconnected
and owned by multinational corporations) to force us to practically support
the entire system whenever we support any particular company. When I don't
work for them, they don't get to use my labor to perpetuate the status
quo. When I don't receive an income from them, I don't have capital to
give back to them for them to use to perpetuate the status quo. And most
of all, my time and energy are mine to be used to fight against them,
rather than to support present conditions. For example&#151;how many of you
know vegans who work at places that serve meat and dairy products, or
other people in similar situations? We have to get away from that sort
of thing. </p>
<h3>HOW</h3>
<p> Really, everybody already knows everything I've just described. Most
people, if they had the choice, would love to leave their jobs or at least
get new ones. Well-publicized, reputable poles have estimated the proportion
of Americans unhappy with their jobs to be as high as 90%. That's shocking,
considering that our work is usually the most central and important thing
in our lives. But people don't feel that they have any alternatives. The
companies they work for will only let them have the goods and services
they need to survive if they earn the money to pay for them. </p>
<p> My solution to that problem is to see which goods and services I can
do without, and to look elsewhere for the others. I don't buy Pepsi to
drink with every meal&#151;that stuff isn't too good for you anyway, and Pepsi
Co. is involved in some really bad shit. I don't spend a lot of money
in bars or nightclubs; there are plenty of free activities I can do with
my friends that are just as exciting. I don't buy fashionable or expensive
clothing. I don't spend money on expensive amenities that are supposed
to "save time"&#151;because the truth is, they don't. Otherwise, where the
fuck is all the time we should have saved up by now with our fast food,
our microwave ovens, our automobiles, our fax machines, our computers?
We're busier than ever today, overloaded with so many different demands
on our time from these different "time-saving" devices and the jobs we
work at to buy them. </p>
<p> So where do I get food, shelter, and other necessities? Food&#151;I almost
never pay for it. Here, even in North Carolina, which is not too diverse
socially or culturally, we have this thing called Food Not Bombs. F.N.B.
is basically a group of people who go to all the restaurants, grocery
stores, etc. and collect the food they are going to throw away at the
end of each day&#151;because it's no secret that a LOT of perfectly good food
goes to waste in those places. F.N.B. then serves this food downtown so
that everyone who is hungry can have food to eat. I eat there twice a
week, and each time they have a fair bit of food (bread, vegetables, canned
food, etc.) left over that I can take home with me. Even if your town
has nothing like Food Not Bombs, you can put the ideas into practice easily
enough&#151;before F.N.B. started here, I used to go to my friend's burrito
shop and collect the beans, chips, and rice they would have thrown away
at closing time. The Hare Krishnas serve free dinners here too, once a
week, and I have no scruples about eating their food&#151;who knows what they
would do with those resources if they weren't spending them on keeping
me fed? You can probably find similar opportunities that are unique to
your area if you look. The consumer economy thrives on excess, so why
not take advantage of it? Obviously this system wouldn't work if everybody
in the world tried to do it, but that's not going to happen for a long
time, if it ever does... so in the meantime we should get by however we
can as individuals. We'll worry about arranging a completely work-free
world when that actually looks like it might be in range. </p>
<p> Far too many useful things besides food are thrown away in our conspicuously
consuming society, for that matter. You can get nice furniture that college
students leave by the dumpsters at the end of the school year when they
move out of their apartments. I have friends who have found everything
from working clocks, stereos, and vacuum cleaners to new athletic shoes
in dumpsters. And if you find the right thrift shop (not "vintage clothing"
shop) you can dress yourself pretty well for less pocket change than you
can scrape out of a public fountain in one night. </p>
<p> Shelter is the second most serious challenge to a person who wants to
avoid working (health care is the most serious, and I don't have any easy
answers for that one yet). In Europe and, to a lesser extent, New York,
squatting is a possibility. People often complain to me that squats are
too dirty and dangerous for them, but I think if the people who do not
choose to live under dirty and dangerous conditions normally were to organize
squats of their own, that (obviously) their squats would not be too dirty
or dangerous. Think how much fucking money you could save if you didn't
pay rent! Even if squatting is not an option (since it is sort of discouraged
by the authorities), it's possible to arrange cheap places to live. Plenty
of people I know pay only a little over a hundred dollars a month to share
an old house with a bunch of friends. I've known people who have been
paid to stay at someone's house and take care of it while they were gone;
I've known people who have worked on the house where they lived (painted
it, etc.) in exchange for paying little or no rent; the list goes on.
The possibilities are endless and ever changing, so I can only give examples
here&#151;you have to find concrete opportunities for yourself. </p>
<p> As for things that have to do with the hardcore scene&#151;often if you're
active, doing something that is useful to people (because I'm trying to
encourage that here by speaking out against work, NOT discourage it!)
you can barter it for the records, 'zines., etc. that you're interested
in. If you write reviews, you can get all that stuff for free; you could
trade a traveling band food or a place to sleep in return for their record;
you could trade some rare records for a tattoo or vice versa; trade a
copy of your friend's 'zine for another one that interests you; volunteer
to help organize and clean up after a show in return for free admission.
</p>
<p> Another way to make ends meet when you're unemployed is&#151;brace yourself&#151;stealing
from corporations. This can range from the very petty to the other side
of the spectrum. You can get a variety of materials you may need from
some simple, low risk urban hunting and gathering. Toilet paper is, obviously,
everywhere; so are cleaning products, matches, salt and pepper, coathangers,
cardboard boxes, light bulbs, batteries (you can get them out of smoke
detectors, for example, if you don't think it will endanger anyone), staples
and staplers, pens, soap&#151;just keep your eyes open. Copy shops often have
tape, folders, markers, paper, and a million other typical "office" needs
(it's a well-known fact that Kinko's has financed punk rock in the U.S.A.
almost single-handedly). For that matter, stealing from the workplace
is a time-honored American tradition, since so many people are so frustrated
there; if you make friends with people who do work at these companies,
chances are they will be happy to share a little of their companies' resources
with you. Example? Since Inside Front #4, three years ago, I haven't paid
for a single xerox copy; that includes thousands of copies of each issue
from 4 through 7, thousands of pamphlets, and literally tens of thousands
of fliers. </p>
<p> Do I feel bad about this? No. Corporations are distinct from traditional
businesses in that they exist as separate financial entities from their
owners. When you steal from a large corporation, you're stealing from
a business entity that exists to perpetuate itself rather than from a
private individual. Sure, private individuals profit from these corporations,
and some of them are not really all that bad; others, though, like Pepsi
or Marlboro, are up to some really bad things, and the less resources
they have to pursue those goals the better. Most of the workers at these
corporations receive a set salary, and will not suffer too much if you
steal from the corporation. These corporations, in fact, usually figure
some loss from theft, etc. into their budgets&#151;they know that's the price
they must pay for doing business in an environment where their workers
feel little loyalty to their employers or fulfillment in their work, and
many people in society are hungry, fed up with their jobs, and fed up
with being "honest" and waiting fruitlessly for change. If you actually
did steal more from a company than they were prepared for, the people
who will probably lose money are the stockholders&#151;and the majority of
stock is not held by working class men and women who are counting on it
to be able to take care of their families. And if so much theft somehow
occurred that these huge corporations like Kmart and McDonalds had to
close, I would shed no tears about it! These companies and the multinationals
that own them would disappear, never again to wreak wholesale destruction
upon the earth's environment, never again to sell the same unhealthy,
nasty-tasting hamburgers in every town from Los Angeles to Moscow through
sheer force of advertising dollars. Perhaps they would be replaced by
individuals who could be held accountable for their behavior by their
communities; individuals who would care about their communities and act
accordingly, rather than having to obey the impersonal and disinterested
orders of a faceless profit machine. Individuals like my friend who owns
the Burrito shop, who would give me food when he knew I couldn't afford
it&#151;because he knew I would do the same for him. </p>
<p> Anyway... Certainly, I'll admit it does take some time and energy to
avoid working; you have to spend a fair bit of each figuring out how to
survive without a steady income (at least you can do this on your own
time, when and how you want to). Not to mention that you will have to
go without some comforts and conveniences you may have been used to; but
is that stuff really more important to you than anything else? Of course,
more than anything else, it helps to have the support and camaraderie
of your friends in an undertaking like staying unemployed, and that's
where our hardcore community comes into this. </p>
<h3>How Does This Relate to Hardcore?</h3>
<p> Being a one-person economy is extremely difficult. Even if you don't
work, you will still have no free time if you have to arrange all your
food, all your shelter, all of your needs for yourself from scratch. But
with others to work with, it becomes a lot easier. Food Not Bombs, the
organization that I mentioned earlier, works so easily and smoothly because
it is a group effort. Because a number of people help with obtaining the
food, cooking, serving, and cleaning, it isn't that much work for any
one individual, and the whole thing seems more like a friendly social
event than a demanding task. The same goes for all the other ways of obtaining
resources to stay unemployed&#151;not only are they easier in groups, but
you will feel less alienated from the world if you do them with others.
</p>
<p> Imagine if the hardcore scene wasn't just a bunch of kids wearing funny
clothes, practicing their dance moves and camera angles at punk shows
once every couple weeks. Imagine if everyone in the hardcore community,
at least those who could (because of course not everyone can), quit their
jobs and used all the potential energy we have as idealistic young people
to try to develop a new way of life. We could use the networks we have
already set up for touring bands, distribution, etc. to support each other
in our attempt to break away from the employment system. Imagine how much
creative energy would be unleashed, if we all stopped exhausting ourselves
for "the man" and put that energy back into our own lives! Surely, all
together we would be able to make something like that work. And then we
would no longer be just another subculture with our own characteristic
"rebellious music" and "fashionable clothing." We would be a fucking counterculture,
a force that would work effectively against the status quo we all claim
to reject&#151;for the contents of our daily lives would, by themselves, do
more to change the way the world works than our words ever could. </p>
<p> Does this sound difficult? It probably will be! But whether it is impossible
or not can only be determined by trying it. And besides, what do we have
to lose? Are our diet sodas and home entertainment systems really worth
the lives we must sell away to buy them? </p>
