<h1>Twelve Myths About Direct Action</h1>
<p>Direct
action&#8212;that is, any kind of action that bypasses established
political channels to accomplish objectives directly&#8212;has
a long and rich heritage in North America, extending back
to the Boston Tea Party and beyond. Despite this, there
are many misunderstandings about it, in part due to the
ways it has been misrepresented in the corporate media.<br>
<h3>
1. Direct action is terrorism.</h3>
<p>Terrorism is calculated to intimidate and thus paralyze
people. Direct action, on the other hand, is intended to
inspire and thus motivate people by demonstrating the power
individuals have to accomplish goals themselves. While terrorism
is the domain of a specialized class that seeks to acquire
power for itself alone, direct action demonstrates possibilities
that others can make use of, empowering people to take control
of their own lives. At most, a given direct action may obstruct
the activities of a corporation or institution that activists
perceive to be committing an injustice, but this is simply
a form of civil disobedience, not terrorism.</p>
<h3>2. Direct action is violent.</h3>
<p>To say that it is violent to destroy the machinery of a
slaughterhouse or to break windows belonging to a party
that promotes war is to prioritize property over human and
animal life. This objection subtly validates violence against
living creatures by focusing all attention on property rights
and away from more fundamental issues.</p>
<h3>3. Direct action is not political expression, but
criminal activity.</h3><p>
Unfortunately, whether or not an action is illegal is a
poor measure of whether or not it is just. The Jim Crow
laws were, after all, laws. To object to an action on the
grounds that it is illegal is to sidestep the more important
question of whether or not it is ethical. To argue that
we must always obey laws, even when we consider them to
be unethical or to enforce unethical conditions, is to suggest
that the arbitrary pronouncements of the legal establishment
possess a higher moral authority than our own consciences,
and to demand complicity in the face of injustice. When
laws protect injustice, illegal activity is no vice, and
law-abiding docility is no virtue.</p>
<h3>4. Direct action is unnecessary where people have
freedom of speech.</h3><p>
In a society dominated by an increasingly narrowly focused
corporate media, it can be almost impossible to initiate
a public dialogue on a subject unless something occurs that
brings attention to it. Under such conditions, direct action
can be a means of nurturing free speech, not squelching
it. Likewise, when people who would otherwise oppose an
injustice have accepted that it is inevitable, it is not
enough simply to talk about it: one must demonstrate that
it is possible to do something about it.</p>
<h3>5. Direct action is alienating.</h3><p>
On the contrary, many people who find traditional party
politics alienating are inspired and motivated by direct
action. Different people find different approaches fulfilling;
a movement that is to be broad-based must include a wide
range of options. Sometimes people who share the goals of
those who practice direct action while objecting to their
means spend all their energy decrying an action that has
been carried out. In doing so, they snatch defeat from the
jaws of victory: they would do better to seize the opportunity
to focus all attention on the issues raised by the action.</p>
<h3>
6. People who practice direct action should work through
the established political channels instead.</h3><p>
Many people who practice direct action also work within
the system. A commitment to making use of every institutional
means of solving problems does not necessarily preclude
an equal commitment to picking up where such means leave
off.</p>
<h3>7. Direct action is exclusive.</h3><p>
Some forms of direct action are not open to all, but this
does not necessarily mean they are without worth. Everyone
has different preferences and capabilities, and should be
free to act according to them. The important question is
how the differing approaches of individuals and groups that
share the same long-term goals can be integrated in such
a way that they complement each other.</p>
<h3>8. Direct action is cowardly.</h3><p>
This accusation is almost always made by those who have
the privilege of speaking and acting in public without fearing
repercussions: that is to say, those who have power in this
society, and those who obediently accept their power. Should
the heroes of the French Resistance have demonstrated their
courage and accountability by acting against the Nazi occupying
army in the full light of day, thus dooming themselves to
defeat? For that matter, in a nation increasingly terrorized
by police and federal surveillance of just about everyone,
is it any wonder that those who express dissent might want
to protect their privacy while doing so?</p>
<h3>9. Direct action is practiced only by college students/privileged
rich kids/desperate poor people/etc.</h3><p>
This allegation is almost always made without reference
to concrete facts, as a smear. In fact, direct action is
and long has been practiced in a variety of forms by people
of all walks of life. The only possible exception to this
would be members of the wealthiest and most powerful classes,
who have no need to practice any kind of illegal or controversial
action because, as if by coincidence, the established political
channels are perfectly suited to their needs.</p>
<h3>10. Direct action is the work of agents provocateurs.</h3><p>
This is another speculation generally made from a distance,
without concrete evidence. To allege that direct action
is always the work of police agent provocateurs is disempowering:
it rules out the possibility that activists could do such
things themselves, overestimating the powers of police intelligence
and reinforcing the illusion that the State is omnipotent.
Likewise, it preemptively dismisses the value and reality
of a diversity of tactics. When people feel entitled to
make unfounded claims that every tactic of which they disapprove
is a police provocation, this obstructs the very possibility
of constructive dialogue about appropriate tactics.</p>
<h3>
11. Direct action is dangerous and can have negative repercussions
for others.</h3><p>
Direct action can be dangerous in a repressive political
climate, and it is important that those who practice it
make every effort not to endanger others. This is not necessarily
an objection to it, however--on the contrary, when it becomes
dangerous to act outside established political channels,
it becomes all the more important to do so. Authorities
may use direct actions as excuses to terrorize innocents,
as Hitler did when the Reichstag was set afire, but those
in power are the ones who must answer for the injustices
they commit in so doing, not those who oppose them. Likewise,
though people who practice direct action may indeed run
risks, in the face of an insufferable injustice it can be
more dangerous and irresponsible to leave it uncontested.</p>
<h3>
12. Direct action never accomplishes anything.</h3><p>
Every effective political movement throughout history, from
the struggle for the eight hour workday to the fight for
women's suffrage, has made use of some form of direct action.
Direct action can complement other forms of political activity
in a variety of ways. If nothing else, it highlights the
necessity for institutional reforms, giving those who push
for them more bargaining chips; but it can go beyond this
supporting role to suggest the possibility of an entirely
different organization of human life, in which power is
distributed equally and all people have an equal and direct
say in all matters that affect them.</p>
