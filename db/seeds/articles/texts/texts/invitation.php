<h1>Invitation to the <br />
CrimethInc. &ldquo;Inner Circle&rdquo;</h1>
</p>
<p> <i>WANTED:</i> Creative, independent men and women, tired of being exhausted
by the trivial details of modern survival, fed up with being bored by
modern entertainment, no longer confused by the distractions of the mass
media... not content with limiting their freedom, their lives, to their
"free time." People who prefer idealism to realism, and reality to ideology.
To become full-time revolutionaries. NOT armchair revolutionaries, not
lunch break revolutionaries, not leisure-time revolutionaries. And not
"professional" revolutionaries: rather than making a business out of "revolution.,"
they must make revolution their business. Men and women who will not allow
their efforts to win back their freedom to become just another job, who
are ready to live according to their desires around the clock. </p>
<p> Punk Rockers&#151; don't be content with living in a world of your own
making once a week, when a band plays. Demand that excitement every day,
demand that self-determination every morning when you wake up. </p>
<p>Musicians, Artists&#151;seek not to "make a living from your art," as
any worker who sells his labor (and thus his creativity) for money does.
Seek to make art your way of living&#151;or, even better, make living
your art. For life is contagious: if you want to make others feel it,
you must live it to the fullest yourself, so that it will call out to
them through you. If you would make art to share with them, you must first
share yourself, give yourself to your art and your life. </p>
<p>Human Beings&#151; Look at the world around us; it is a world that we
have created. We transformed the old world into this one&#151;but why
this one? Is this the world we would have chosen, if we had considered
in advance the question of what the best of all possible worlds might
be? But before you despair, think&#151;we created this world, it is we
who make it up. Could we not make another world out of it, then, if we
chose? </p>
