<h1>You Are Under Surveillance</h1>
<p>Public
space is increasingly policed by hidden surveillance systems.
The private life of the individual is secretly captured,
mapped, collected, and owned in effigy by a cabal of private
business operations&#8212;the security industry.</p>
<p>
Ironically, as communities disintegrate and more and more
of us find ourselves lost in a faceless mass of consumers,
the only ones we can count on to interest themselves in
our lives are the enforcers of the laws that govern spaces
designated for consumption. Reclaiming space from surveillance
would reinforce our freedom to act privately, for ourselves
and each other rather than the cameras, and thus enable
us to come together out of our anonymity. We&#8217;ve had
our fifteen minutes of fame&#8212;now point that thing somewhere
else!</p>
<p>
Such oppressive security measures are only necessary when
wealth and power are distributed so unfairly that human
beings cannot coexist in peace. The ones who oversee these
security systems are mistaken when they claim that order
must be established to clear the way for liberty and equality.
The opposite is true: order is only possible as a consequence
of people living together with freedom, equality, and justice
for all. Anything else is simply repression. If cameras
are necessary on every corner, then something is fundamentally
wrong in our society, and getting rid of the cameras is
as good a starting place as any.</p>
<p>
As a culture, we are preoccupied with observation, images,
spectatorship. Now internet advertisements offer consumers
spy cameras and hidden microphones of our own, completing
the three steps to panopticon: we watch monitors, we are
monitored, we become our own monitors. But when the distinction
between observer and observed is dissolved, we do not regain
wholeness&#8212;on the contrary, we find we have been trapped
outside ourselves, alienated in the most fundamental sense.</p>
<p>
Here&#8217;s a quixotic project&#8212;get together with
your friends and disable all the security cameras in your
city, declaring it a free action zone. You know what they
say about dancing like nobody&#8217;s watching.</p>

<h3><em>What&#8217;s
So Bad About Video Surveillance?</em></h3>
<p>
The past several years have seen a dramatic increase in
closed circuit television camera surveillance of public
space. Video cameras peer at us from the sides of buildings,
from ATM machines, from traffic lights, capturing our every
move for observation by police officers and private security
guards. The effectiveness of these devices in reducing crime
is dubious at best, and cases of misuse by public and private
authorities have raised serious concerns about video monitoring
in public space.</p>
<p> These are a few examples of people who might legitimately
want to avoid having their picture taken by unseen observers:</p>
<h4>Minorities</h4>
<p> One of the big problems with video surveillance is the tendency
of police officers and security guards to single out particular
people for monitoring. It is hardly surprising that the
mentality that produced racial profiling in traffic stops
has found similar expression in police officers focusing
their cameras on people of color. A study of video surveillance
in the UK, the leading user of CCTV surveillance systems,
revealed that &#8220;black people were between one-and-a-half
and two-and-a-half times more likely to be surveilled than
one would expect from their presence in the population.&#8221;
It is worth pointing out that, in this study, 40% of people
that the police targeted were picked out &#8220;for no obvious
reason,&#8221; other than their ethnicity or apparent membership
in subcultural groups. In other words, they were singled
out not for what they were doing, but for the way they looked
alone.</p>
<h4>
Women</h4>
<p>Police monitors can&#8217;t seem to keep it in their pants
when it comes to video surveillance. In a Hull University
study, 1 out of 10 women were targeted for &#8220;voyeuristic&#8221;
reasons by male camera operators, and a Brooklyn police
sergeant blew the whistle on several of her colleagues in
1998 for &#8220;taking pictures of civilian women in the
area&#8230; from breast shots to the backside.&#8221;</p>
<h4>
Youth</h4>
<p>Young men, particularly young black men, are routinely singled
out by police operators for increased scrutiny. This is
particularly true if they appear to belong to subcultural
groups that authority figures find suspicious or threatening.
Do you wear baggy pants or shave your head? Smile&#8212;you&#8217;re
on candid camera!</p>
<h4>
Outsiders</h4>
<p>The Hull University study also found a tendency of CCTV
operators to focus on people whose appearance or activities
marked them as being &#8220;out of place.&#8221; This includes
people loitering outside of shops, or homeless people panhandling.
Not surprisingly, this group includes individuals observed
to be expressing their opposition to the CCTV cameras.</p>
<h4>
Activists</h4>
<p>Experience has shown that CCTV systems may be used to spy
on activist groups engaged in legal forms of dissent or
discussion. For example, the City College of New York was
embarrassed several years ago by student activists who found,
much to their dismay, that the administration had installed
surveillance cameras in their meeting areas. This trend
shows no signs of abating: one of the more popular demonstrations
of CCTV capabilities that law enforcement officials and
manufacturers like to cite is the ability to read the text
of fliers that activists post on public lampposts.</p>
<h4>
Everyone else</h4>
<p>Let&#8217;s face it&#8212;we all do things that are perfectly
legal, but that we still may not want to share with the
rest of the world. Kissing your lover on the street, interviewing
for a new job without your current employer&#8217;s knowledge,
visiting a psychiatrist&#8212;these are everyday activities
that constitute our personal, private lives. While there
is nothing wrong with any of them, there are perfectly good
reasons why we may choose to keep them secret from coworkers,
neighbors, or anyone else.</p>
<h3>
But what&#8217;s the harm?</h3>
<p>Clearly, video surveillance of public space represents an
invasion of personal privacy. But so what? Having one&#8217;s
picture taken from time to time seems a small price to pay
for the security benefits such surveillance offers. It&#8217;s
not like anyone ever sees the tapes, and let&#8217;s be
honest&#8212;being singled out for scrutiny by remote operators
without your even knowing about it is not at all the same
as being pulled over, intimidated and harassed by a live
cop.</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, it&#8217;s not that simple. The fact is,
there is very little oversight of video surveillance systems,
and the question of who owns the tapes&#8212;and who has
the right to see them&#8212;is still largely undecided.</p>
<p> Many of the cameras monitoring public space are privately
owned. Banks, office buildings, and department stores all
routinely engage in continuous video monitoring of their
facilities and of any adjacent public space. The recordings
they make are privately owned, and may be stored, broadcast,
or sold to other companies without permission, disclosure,
or payment to the people involved.</p>
<p>
Similarly, video footage that is captured by public police
departments may be considered part of the &#8220;public
record,&#8221; and as such are available for the asking
to individuals, companies, and government agencies. At present,
there is precious little to prevent television programs
like &#8220;Cops&#8221; and &#8220;America&#8217;s Funniest
Home Movies&#8221; from broadcasting surveillance video
without ever securing permission from their subjects.</p>
<p>
Sound far-fetched? Already in the UK&#8212;the country that
so far has made the most extensive use of CCTV systems (although
the Canada and US are catching up)&#8212;there have been
such cases. In the 1990&#8217;s, Barrie Goulding released
&#8220;Caught in the Act,&#8221; a video compilation of
&#8220;juicy bits&#8221; from street video surveillance
systems. Featuring intimate contacts&#8212;including one
scene of a couple having sex in an elevator&#8212;this video
sensationalized footage of ordinary people engaged in (mostly)
legal but nonetheless private acts.</p>
<p>
Similarly, there has been a proliferation of &#8220;spy
cam&#8221; websites featuring clandestine footage of women
in toilets, dressing rooms, and a variety of other locations.
A lack of legislative oversight allows these sites to operate
legally, but even if new laws are passed, the nature of
the internet makes prosecutions highly unlikely.</p>
<p>
As video surveillance systems evolve and become more sophisticated,
the opportunities for abuse are compounded. Sophisticated
video systems can identify the faces of individuals (matching
video images to databases of known faces&#8212;for example,
the repository of driver&#8217;s license photos maintained
by the Department of Motor Vehicles), the objects they carry
(including, for example, reading the text on personal documents),
and their activities. These systems enable the creation
of databases that detail who you are, where you&#8217;ve
been, when you were there, and what you were doing&#8230;
databases that are conceivably available to a host of people
with whom you&#8217;d rather not share such information,
including employers, ex-lovers, and television producers.</p>
<p>
Beyond these concerns, there is the question of the societal
impact of our increasing reliance on surveillance, and our
growing willingness to put ourselves under the microscope
of law enforcement and commercial interests. Once a cold-war
caricature of Soviet-style communist regimes, the notion
of the &#8220;surveillance society&#8221; is now employed
unironically to describe modern urban life in such supposed
bastions of personal liberty and freedom as the United States,
United Kingdom, and Canada.</p>
<p>
While the nature of such a society has long been theorized
by philosophers, critics, and sociologists (Jeremy Bentham,
anyone?), the psychological and social effects of living
under constant surveillance are not yet well understood.
However, the impact of CCTV systems on crime is beginning
to become clear.</p>
<h3>Video Surveillance and Crime</h3>
<p>Touted as a high-tech solution to social problems of crime
and disorder by manufacturers selling expensive video surveillance
systems to local governments and police departments, CCTV
has gained much popularity in recent years. These manufactures
claim that CCTV&#8212;which often costs upwards of $400,000
to install in a limited area&#8212;will dramatically decrease
criminal activity, and provide a measure of security heretofore
unknown to the general public. Yet these CCTV systems are
often purchased at the expense of other, less oppressive,
less expensive, already proven law-enforecement methods
such as community policing, and the statistics do not bear
out their claims.</p>
<p>
CCTV is often promoted with thinly veiled references to
the threat of terrorism: hence their widespread use in the
UK, which has long lived with bomb threats and other violent
actions. Following the September 11 attacks, video surveillance
manufacturers have increased their efforts to court the
American public&#8212;with some success, as evidenced by
recent gains in these companies&#8217; share prices.</p>
<p>
Attempting to capitalize on an international tragedy to
sell products in this manner is tastelessly opportunistic
at best&#8212;but given the track record of CCTV systems
to date, it&#8217;s downright cynical. According to studies
of the effectiveness of video surveillance in use throughout
the UK, there is no conclusive evidence that the presence
of CCTV has any impact whatsoever on local crime rates.
While there have been examples of reduced criminality in
areas where CCTV has been installed, these reductions can
just as easily be explained by other factors, including
general decreases in crime throughout the UK. Indeed, in
several areas where CCTV was installed, crime rates actually
increased.</p>
<p>
Given the widespread use of these systems, it is surprising
how infrequently they lead to arrests. According to one
report, a 22-month long surveillance of New York&#8217;s
Times Square led to only 10 arrests, and the cameras involved
have since been removed. Furthermore, the types of crime
against which CCTV is most effective are small fry compared
to the terrorism and kidnappings its advocates&#8217; claim
it stops. A study of CCTV use in the UK found that the majority
of arrests in which video surveillance played a significant
role were made to stop fistfights. Not only that, but these
were relatively infrequent already; and this hardly seems
to justify the exorbitant costs and loss of privacy associated
with these systems.</p>
<p>
Even more disturbing, if not at all surprising, was the
study&#8217;s finding that incidents of police brutality
and harassment captured by CCTV surveillance were routinely
ignored. The tapes of these events also had a tendency to
be &#8220;lost&#8221; by operators.</p>
<p>
The effect of video surveillance on criminal psychology
is not well understood. One Los Angeles study found that
cameras in a retail store were perceived by criminals as
a challenge, and thus encouraged additional shoplifting.</p>
<p>
At best, CCTV seems not to reduce crime, but merely to divert
it to other areas. According to one Boston police official,
&#8220;criminals get used to the cameras and tend to move
out of sight.&#8221;</p>
<h3>
Now More Than Ever</h3>
<p>Given heightened awareness of public safety and increased
demand for greater security in the face of growing threats
of terrorist violence, projects that undermine systems for
social control may seem to some to be in poor taste. But
it is our position that such times call all the more strongly
for precisely these kinds of projects. There is a vital
need for independent voices that cry out against the cynical
exploitation of legitimate human fear and suffering for
political power and monetary gain.</p>
