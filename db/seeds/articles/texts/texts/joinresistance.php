<p> Falling in love is the ultimate act of revolution, of resistance to
today's tedious, socially restrictive, culturally constrictive, humanly
meaningless world. </p>
<p> Love transforms the world. Where the lover formerly felt boredom, he
now feels passion. Where she once was complacent, she now is excited and
compelled to self-asserting action. The world which once seemed empty
and tiresome becomes filled with meaning, filled with risks and rewards,
with majesty and danger. Life for the lover is a gift, an adventure with
the highest possible stakes; every moment is memorable, heartbreaking
in its fleeting beauty. When he falls in love, a man who once felt disoriented,
alienated, and confused will know exactly what he wants. Suddenly his
existence will make sense to him; suddenly it becomes valuable, even glorious
and noble, to him. Burning passion is an antidote that will cure the worst
cases of despair and resigned obedience. </p>
<p> Love makes it possible for individuals to connect to others in a meaningful
way&#151;it impels them to leave their shells and risk being honest and spontaneous
together, to come to know each other in profound ways. Thus love makes
it possible for them to care about each other genuinely, rather than at
the end of the gun of Christian doctrine. But at the same time, it plucks
the lover out of the routines of everyday life and separates her from
other human beings. She will feel a million miles away from the herd of
humanity, living as she is in a world entirely different from theirs.
</p>
<p> In this sense love is subversive, because it poses a threat to the established
order of our modern lives. The boring rituals of workday productivity
and socialized etiquette will no longer mean anything to a man who has
fallen in love, for there are more important forces guiding him than mere
inertia and deference to tradition. Marketing strategies that depend upon
apathy or insecurity to sell the products that keep the economy running
as it does will have no effect upon him. Entertainment designed for passive
consumption, which depends upon exhaustion or cynicism in the viewer,
will not interest him. </p>

<p> There is no place for the passionate, romantic lover in today's world,
business or private. For he can see that it might be more worthwhile to
hitchhike to Alaska (or to sit in the park and watch the clouds sail by)
with his sweetheart than to study for his calculus exam or sell real estate,
and if he decides that it is, he will have the courage to do it rather
than be tormented by unsatisfied longing. He knows that breaking into
a cemetery and making love under the stars will make for a much more memorable
night than watching television ever could. So love poses a threat to our
consumer-driven economy, which depends upon consumption of (largely useless)
products and the labor that this consumption necessitates to perpetuate
itself. </p>
<p> Similarly, love poses a threat to our political system, for it is difficult
to convince a man who has a lot to live for in his personal relationships
to be willing to fight and die for an abstraction such as the state; for
that matter, it may be difficult to convince him to even pay taxes. It
poses a threat to cultures of all kinds, for when human beings are given
wisdom and valor by true love they will not be held back by traditions
or customs which are irrelevant to the feelings that guide them. </p>
<p> Love even poses a threat to our society itself. Passionate love is ignored
and feared by the bourgeoisie, for it poses a great danger to the stability
and pretense they covet. Love permits no lies, no falsehoods, not even
any polite half-truths, but lays all emotions bare and reveals secrets
which domesticated men and women cannot bear. You cannot lie with your
emotional and sexual response; situations or ideas will excite or repel
you whether you like it or not, whether it is polite or not, whether it
is advisable or not. One cannot be a lover and a (dreadfully) responsible,
(dreadfully) respectable member of today's society at the same time; for
love will impel you to do things which are not "responsible" or "respectable."
True love is irresponsible, irrepressible, rebellious, scornful of cowardice,
dangerous to the lover and everyone around her, for it serves one master
alone: the passion that makes the human heart beat faster. It disdains
anything else, be it self-preservation, obedience, or shame. Love urges
men and women to heroism, and to antiheroism&#151;to indefensible acts that
need no defense for the one who loves. </p>

<p> For the lover speaks a different moral and emotional language than the
typical bourgeois man does. The average bourgeois man has no overwhelming,
smoldering desires. Sadly, all he knows is the silent despair that comes
of spending his life pursuing goals set for him by his family, his educators,
his employers, his nation, and his culture, without ever being able to
even consider what needs and wants he might have of his own. Without the
burning fire of desire to guide him, he has no criteria upon which to
choose what is right and wrong for himself. Consequently he is forced
to adopt some dogma or doctrine to direct him through his life. There
are a wide variety of moralities to choose from in the marketplace of
ideas, but which morality a man buys into is immaterial so long as he
chooses one because he is at a loss otherwise as to what he should do
with himself and his life. How many men and women, having never realized
that they had the option to choose their own destinies, wander through
life in a dull haze thinking and acting in accordance with the laws that
have been taught to them, merely because they no longer have any other
idea of what to do? But the lover needs no prefabricated principles to
direct her; her desires identify what is right and wrong for her, for
her heart guides her through life. She sees beauty and meaning in the
world, because her desires paint the world in these colors. She has no
need for dogmas, for moral systems, for commandments and imperatives,
for she knows what to do without instructions. </p>
<p> Thus she does indeed pose quite a threat to our society. What if everyone
decided right and wrong for themselves, without any regard for conventional
morality? What if everyone did whatever they wanted to, with the courage
to face any consequences? What if everyone feared loveless, lifeless monotony
more than they fear taking risks, more than they fear being hungry or
cold or in danger? What if everyone set down their "responsibilities"
and "common sense," and dared to pursue their wildest dreams, to set the
stakes high and live each day as if it were the last? Think what a place
the world would be! Certainly it would be different than it is now&#151;and
it is quite a truism that people from the "mainstream," the simultaneous
keepers and victims of the status quo, fear change. </p>

<p> And so, despite the stereotyped images used in the media to sell toothpaste
and honeymoon suites, genuine passionate love is discouraged in our culture.
Being "carried away by your emotions" is frowned upon; instead we are
raised to always be on our guard lest our hearts lead us astray. Rather
than being encouraged to have the courage to face the consequences of
risks taken in pursuit of our hearts' desires, we are counseled not to
take risks at all, to be "responsible." And love itself is regulated.
Men must not fall in love with other men, nor women with other women,
nor individuals from different ethnic backgrounds with each other, or
else the usual bigots who form the front-line offensive in the assault
of modern Western culture upon the individual will step in. Men and women
who have already entered into a legal/religious contract with each other
are not to fall in love with anyone else, even if they no longer feel
any passion for their marital partner. Love as most of us know it today
is a carefully prescribed and preordained ritual, something that happens
on Friday nights in expensive movie theaters and restaurants, something
that fills the pockets of the shareholders in the entertainment industries
without preventing workers from showing up to the office on time and ready
to reroute phone calls all day long. This regulated, commercial "love"
is nothing like the passionate, burning love that consumes the genuine
lover. These restrictions, expectations, and regulations smother true
love; for love is a wild flower that can never grow within the confines
prepared for it but only appears where it is least expected. </p>
<p> We must fight against these cultural restraints that would cripple and
smother our desires. For it is love that gives meaning to life, desire
that makes it possible for us to make sense of our existence and find
purpose in our lives. Without these, there is no way for us to determine
how to live our lives, except to submit to some authority, to some god,
master or doctrine that will tell us what to do and how to do it without
ever giving us the satisfaction that self-determination does. So fall
in love today, with men, with women, with music, with ambition, with yourself.
. . with life! </p>

<p><em>One might say that it is ridiculous to implore others to fall in love&#151;one
either falls in love or one does not, it is not a choice that can be made
consciously. Emotions do not follow the instructions of the rational mind.
But the environment in which we must live out our lives has a great influence
on our emotions, and we can make rational decisions that will affect this
environment. It should be possible to work to change an environment that
is hostile to love into an environment that will encourage it. Our task
must be to engineer our world so that it is a world in which people can
and do fall in love, and thus to reconstitute human beings so that we
will be ready for the "revolution" spoken of in these pages&#151;so that we
will be able to find meaning and happiness in our lives.</em> </p>
