<h1>Fighting Terrorism  Begins at Home</h1>
<h5>How and why
we used direct action to thwart<br />
a fascist rally, and what
we learned</h5>
<h6><em>report

<p>Our
story begins at the polar opposite of liberation and self-determination:
an utterly apolitical, consumerist macho hardcore show.
A former bandmate of mine was on tour with a popular band
in the genre, and I went to see them at the rock club where
they were opening for another band that had a music video
on MTV. There were four fights during their set alone.</p>
<p>
With the exception of the few minutes I got to watch my
friend making music, I would have felt pretty silly being
there&#8212;except that, as usual, I had a secret plan.
Earlier that day, I had learned that the National Socialist
Movement and the Ku Klux Klan were to hold a &#8220;white
unity&#8221; rally at the state capital in a couple weeks&#8212;and
I was interested in whether anyone else felt like this was
a bad thing. I made an announcement about it before their
band played, and afterwards collected a list of contacts
from everyone who was interested in knowing more. Among
these were, shockingly enough, a group of marines and a
local part-time police officer; I&#8217;d finally happened
upon an issue that could bring people together from as disparate
walks of life as these right wing jarheads and a grizzled,
willfully unemployed revolutionary anarchist like myself.</p>
<p>
I also met some old friends there, people I hadn&#8217;t
seen in a long time. Though they had little experience with
political activism, they were angry that fascists were going
to be welcomed into their city, and wanted to do something
about it. Perfect. We made plans to meet, and passed the
word along to everyone we trusted.</p>
<p>
Out of this chance interaction, a planning group formed,
which held a series of covert meetings in the days leading
up to the fascist rally. For those who care, our group included
people of a variety of ethnic groups, genders, sexual orientations,
and body types; also, just as importantly, it consisted
of a range of participants from longtime militant activists
to people who didn&#8217;t consider themselves political
at all. One of my greatest frustrations with political activism
as it is sometimes practiced is that in the process of purporting
to protect against alienating people, activists alienate
everyone who isn&#8217;t similarly obsessed with radical
protocol and procedure. This was not the case in our group:
our discussions were informal, we had no membership list,
no one needed any prior knowledge of activist culture to
feel welcome.</p>
<p>
We decided we were going to do our best to prevent the rally
from happening at all, or, failing that, to make it as trying
as possible for the fascists and the city that was hosting
them. But why, you ask&#8212;don&#8217;t the fascists have
the right to free speech, just like everybody else? And
doesn&#8217;t confronting them just make their position
look more attractive? Before we proceed with the account,
let&#8217;s go over these questions.</p>
<p>
First of all, for an anarchist like me, the question of
&#8220;the right to free speech&#8221; is a moot point.
Talk of &#8220;rights&#8221; only makes sense if you accept
the existence of an all-powerful state which grants them
and can take them away. If you don&#8217;t believe in recognizing
the authority of a governing power that holds all our &#8220;rights&#8221;
hostage, but instead believe that social life has to be
cooperatively determined by those in the thick of it, the
question is not whether someone has the &#8220;right&#8221;
to do something, but whether or not what they&#8217;re doing
is a good, socially responsible thing. The government might
grant a corporation the &#8220;right&#8221; to destroy a
forest or evict people from their homes, but that wouldn&#8217;t
make it right for us to stand idly by while they did so.
The idea that any government can dole out rights impartially
is a fallacy, anyway; as those in power inevitably use that
power to represent their own interests, we might as well
use whatever power we have to represent ours. Besides, the
moment the Nazis and the Klan have the chance, they&#8217;ll
be thrilled to prevent people like you and me from exercising
any so-called rights at all. Protecting their right to organize
towards depriving others of rights, on the grounds that
it&#8217;s necessary to maintain the system of rights, is
naive at best, if not outright duplicitous.</p>
<p>
As for the &#8220;just ignore them and they&#8217;ll go
away&#8221; school of thought, that didn&#8217;t work in
Italy, Germany, or Spain a few generations back, and it
hasn&#8217;t worked lately in Europe either, where a powerful
new fascist movement has been gaining a foothold. These
fascist groups, once allowed to recruit members and get
active, quickly begin targeting immigrants, radicals, and
others with violence; the only solution that has worked
is for activists to block their attempts to organize from
the very beginning. In fact, scarcely two and a half decades
earlier, a similar rally held by the same organizations
in a city only an hour away from this one had ended in the
murders of anti-fascist protesters, for which the police
never found anyone guilty even though it was obvious who
had committed them. Our reluctance to let this rally go
unchallenged did not proceed from idle concerns.</p>
<p>
Aside from the fascists themselves, we also had a bone to
pick with the city. If they had not offered police protection,
the fascists surely would not have dared show up to preach
their hate and violence, for fear of a taste of their own
medicine. As it turned out, the city must have spent tens
of thousands of dollars&#8212;at the least&#8212;to make
this rally possible. I know from plenty of experience at
demonstrations that cities usually only spend that kind
of money to prevent free speech. Having had some of my own
attempts to exercise my &#8220;right to free speech&#8221;
end in tear gas and rubber bullet attacks (which are not
cheap!), I found it particularly insulting that the government
saw fit to allocate so much tax-payer money to enable the
fascists to recruit right on their front lawn. Couldn&#8217;t
that money have been better spent on education programs
or social security, if it had to be spent at all?</p>
<p>
What could be in it for them? Could it be that the conservatives
in power were glad to offer the public the spectacle of
these extreme groups, in comparison with whom they would
appear moderate? Regardless, we decided it would be our
job to make sure they had to work to earn every dollar they
spent on security, and to cost them more than they&#8217;d
bargained for if possible. This would discourage them from
providing protection for future fascist rallies: if they
knew the price tag would be even steeper than it had been
this time, they might just tell the Klan and Nazis they&#8217;d
have to go it alone, which would be fair enough. It would
also highlight the willingness of the city to go to such
great lengths to protect the fascists, which itself deserved
public scrutiny. And in the course of our own efforts, we
hoped to open a space for others to protest the rally as
well, in whatever ways they saw fit.</p>
<p>
When you engage in confrontational action, there&#8217;s
always the possibility you will step on a few toes in the
process. There&#8217;s a certain kind of activist organizer
who gets really offended if everyone doesn&#8217;t follow
the guidelines his group has unilaterally set; in addition
to that, though I&#8217;m not one to believe in the myth
that the masses are so &#8220;moderate&#8221; that any kind
of militant action alienates them, it can in fact happen
that people are intimidated by a masked group whose goals
and tactics aren&#8217;t clear to them. We discussed the
fact that we would be running this risk, and decided that
in this case it was worth it: our first priority was not
to convert people to our perspective, but to stop the fascists
from getting a foothold for theirs. If we did make a bad
impression on any other protesters, that wasn&#8217;t going
to turn them into fascists; and if everyone associated fascists
with chaos and trouble, so much the better. I can imagine
the Nazi &#8220;Commander&#8221; in city hall trying to
get a permit next time, and the functionary explaining:
&#8220;No, last time y&#8217;all came here you brought your
friends the anarchists, and it was a big mess.&#8221;</p>
<p>
Finally, apart from discouraging the fascists and unmasking
the city&#8217;s allegiances, this was a great opportunity
for us proponents of direct action to put our experience
at the service of other rightfully angry people, and get
to know each other better in the bargain. As it turned out,
by the time the event was over we&#8217;d made a lot more
new friends than the Klan or the N.S.M. had.</p>
<p>
Publicly, we took advantage of a few more social events
to announce that counter-rally actions of some kind would
take place, and used the lists thus gathered to send out
reminders; we also wheatpasted fliers and posted notices
on the internet to the same effect. Privately, we worked
on strategy and structure. Those of us whose friends had
been involved in some of the better-known anti-fascist actions
of the preceding years contacted them and asked for pointers.
Some of us explored the area and made annotated maps, which
were distributed at meetings. We gathered what materials
we could, and brainstormed about what approaches to take.
We did our best to spread word of our plans to everyone
who might want to participate, adding specifics according
to the degree to which we felt we could trust them, so as
to prevent information from falling into the wrong hands.</p>
<p>
Shortly thereafter, we learned that a permitted protest
had also been scheduled. Some of us had mixed feelings about
this. It meant, on the one hand, that there would be a safe
zone for protesters who didn&#8217;t want to risk police
repression; on the other hand, in our experience in this
city, whenever a permitted protest occurred it was some
distance from the event being protested, surrounded by a
thick line of police and metal fencing, and proved to be
a disempowering experience for all who participated in it.
As all areas except the permitted zone would be locked down
by police, it was likely that the permitted protest would
absorb all who showed up and the tone of the day would thus
be set by the few who had organized it&#8212;which would
mean all the energy we had put into our organizing was absorbed
by their project, an outcome that would disappoint those
who had accepted our invitation to the event in hopes of
effectively contesting the fascist rally. To top it all
off, organizers of permitted protests sometimes take offense
to any other form of protest organized to take place alongside,
so we had to be careful not to create dissension just by
virtue of acting on our own initiative.</p>
<p>
We concluded that we had to find a point at which to confront
the fascists that was far from the permitted protest, both
for civility&#8217;s sake and to make sure no one was at
risk who did not choose to be. Fortunately, our research
had revealed that they would be using a parking lot on the
opposite side of the rally site from the permitted zone.
Those of us who were prepared for potentially dangerous
physical confrontation planned to form a group that would
advance on the parking lot. There were residential neighborhoods
nearby, which we hoped would be far enough outside the zone
of police surveillance that we could gather there and approach
with the element of surprise. Once in m&ecirc;l&eacute;e
with the police and perhaps the fascists, this group would
stick tightly together, and do everything possible to thwart
arrests. As the police had no knowledge of our plans, we
didn&#8217;t expect they would be prepared to make mass
arrests, so we figured our primary problem was to stop them
from picking off individuals. If we were beset by serious
police attacks, we would retreat into the residential neighborhood,
maintaining our coherence on the way, and then disperse
there where the greatest number of us would be able to escape.
If all else failed, we decided we would break up into our
affinity groups and act individually to cause disruptions.
If we could create an unstable enough situation by any of
these means, we expected the rally would be delayed or canceled.</p>
<p>
A strategy alone is never enough. As things never go as
expected, it is critical to have a structure that can remain
useful when circumstances change. We divided into affinity
groups, and buddied up inside of those; also, several individuals
who were hoping to be noncombatants formed a communications
team. Each of them was equipped with a cell phone or two-way
radio, and chose an area to patrol or a task to fulfill&#8212;taking
down license plate numbers from the fascists&#8217; cars,
for example, or keeping abreast of areas free of police
surveillance to which people could retreat if need be. They
arranged an internal network so that information could be
circulated as swiftly as possible and passed on to one of
two contacts in the action-oriented group. During the event,
they not only monitored the movements of fascists and police,
but also distributed information to all of us when we were
spread out.</p>
<p>
The night before the rally, some brave souls went out with
spray-paint, dressed as civilians. This was a role that
could be played by those of us who felt more comfortable
acting alone than in the chaos of a big demonstration, and
an important one. By morning, the political district of
the city, especially the aforementioned parking lot and
the actual site of the rally, was covered thickly in anti-fascist
graffiti. No matter that the city, clearly hell-bent on
their chosen project of being welcoming hosts to the fascists,
went to the surprising trouble of sandblasting all the graffiti
off by the time the rally was to begin; they were our primary
target readership, and now they have one more serious expense
to factor into their budget next time they consider welcoming
fascists.</p>
<p>
Just before dawn, others went to a hiding place that had
been scouted earlier and stashed our secret weapons: several
4&#8217; by 8&#8217; plywood banners painted with anti-fascist
slogans. These had hand-holds cut into them (though after
one of us had his hand smashed by a police baton while holding
one up, we decided back handles would have been better),
and could be tied together at the ends to form a massive,
jointed, mobile barricade. Carrying these around our group
would make it difficult for police to snatch or beat us,
or for that matter easily identify us or gauge our numbers.
They were also festive, and made our goals clear. In the
future, we&#8217;ll probably use plexiglass instead of plywood,
since one of them finally snapped in half after too much
pressure from police on one side and protesters on the other&#8212;but
we&#8217;ll get to that story shortly.</p>
<p>
We held a final meeting the morning of the big day, to fill
in those who hadn&#8217;t been present at earlier ones and
make some last minute decisions. We picked a convergence
point out in the residential neighborhood, and a time we
hoped would be just long enough before the fascists would
cross from the parking lot to the rally site that we could
stop them, but not so far in advance that the police could
force us to disperse first, or that too few potential participants
in our action would have arrived (since, unfortunately,
those promoting the permitted event had announced the protest
as starting at the same time as the rally, which would be
too late to interfere with it). Until that moment, we would
be scattered into couples and tiny groups, in hopes of avoiding
premature police attention. Our scouts would inform those
of us with communications equipment if anything unexpected
developed&#8212;say, the fascists were heading to the rally
site earlier than expected, or there was already a police
presence at the site of our planned convergence&#8212;and
these spokespeople would pass word around to others, so
we could react quickly.</p>
<p>
We arrived a couple hours before the rally was to begin
to find the entire area swarming with police in and out
of uniform, massive metal fencing surrounding the rally
site, surveillance cameras set up, snipers on the rooftops,
mobile command centers down the block, several officers
on horseback and more in riot gear, and even a helicopter
overhead. It was intimidating, and there was little sign
of other protesters. Our scouts reported that fascists had
already arrived, and were fraternizing with police officers
in a couple areas; however, there didn&#8217;t seem to be
much chance of catching them alone, so we stuck with plan
A.</p>
<p>
We were all dressed as nondescript civilians, but carried
bandannas and sweatshirts with which to render ourselves
anonymous. Walking around the vicinity, we met people we
recognized from other demonstrations and shows, and passed
on to those we trusted the time and location of our convergence
point&#8212;and maps, for those who had come from out of
town. When the time came, we all made our way to the designated
area, doing our best to appear to be nothing more than small
groups moving randomly, and hoping not to hear the familiar
thunder of helicopters overhead.</p>
<p>
The moment was upon us&#8212;we pulled up our masks, grabbed
the banners, and tied them together as we formed our bloc
and made swiftly for the parking lot. There were perhaps
forty of us, and we were going to take on at least one hundred
fifty police, not to mention the thirty-odd fascists that
had occasioned all this trouble. One of us had a great bass
drum, with which to maintain morale&#8212;morale is critical
in such situations, it makes all the difference in what
a group feels capable of doing. Others had emergency whistles,
which make a loud noise while leaving the hands free (though
you should be careful not to damage your hearing with them,
if playing for a long time). Later in the day, the drums
turned out to be extremely useful for centering our group
when it was spread out, and directing motion en masse. More
drums and drummers might have been even more effective at
these purposes, and at least would have saved our drummer
the welts sustained from having to play constantly.</p>
<p>
In a couple minutes we were across the street from the parking
lot, jogging with our banners around us. At this instant,
remarkably, we had the element of surprise on our side:
neither the police nor the fascists were expecting us, we
were throwing them into an unexpected situation and thus
off-balance; the initiative was ours. For the rest of the
day, we were not able to recapture this advantage; much
of what we accomplished proceeded from the moment when we
had it. Arguably, the mistake we made at this juncture was
not to cross the street to the parking lot before the police
reached us. In discussions after the action, it came out
that those who had thought to shout out that it was time
to move across the street held back for fear that there
might be undercover police among us who would identify them
as leaders. In retrospect, we probably had enough coherence
as a group that we could have prevented police from snatching
supposed leaders; but the real solution to such a problem
is to have the feeling of entitlement to make recommendations
more evenly distributed among participants. This happened
as the day wore on and all of us developed more confidence;
unfortunately, police preparations increased at the same
pace our morale did. Strike all at once and go for it while
you have the chance, that&#8217;s the moral of the story.</p>
<p>
Be that as it may, in the next instant a line of police
charged forward and met us in the middle of the street as
we headed for the parking lot. A struggle followed, with
them pushing on the banners from one side, and us from the
other. A couple of us were struck or dragged by the hair
at this point; it&#8217;s worth pointing out, though this
is no surprise, that the police were in fact the ones who
initiated violence that day. All those they tried to grab
for arrests were pulled back by friends. Partly owing to
the general lack of experience in our numbers, at this point
we had not yet developed a strong sense of what we could
accomplish, so many were not as ready to push the limits
as they would be later after they&#8217;d gotten accustomed
to the situation. Consequently, we were pushed back across
the street; but we held our ground there, seizing the corner
of the intersection between the parking lot and the rally
site and holding it in the face of further police pressure.</p>
<p>
A standoff ensued. We stood on the corner, banners up on
the outside, with a line of police in front of us and more
police massing behind them. The fascists in the parking
lot were hiding behind a dumpster, totally out of view and
out of range of projectiles. Over the next few minutes,
our numbers swiftly swelled, as protesters from a variety
of perspectives and walks of life came to join us. In fact,
in taking this corner, we had opened up a vast space around
the rally site for those protesters who didn&#8217;t want
to remain in the permitted zone, and scores rapidly filled
it. This was definitely one of our accomplishments for the
day, that we made it possible for protesters to move around
the area at will, exercising their freedom of speech beyond
the restrictions of the police cordon.</p>
<p>
We had failed to actually meet the fascists in conflict,
but now, having demonstrated our readiness for confrontation,
we were between them and their rally site, and it was clear
to everyone that there would be trouble if they came within
range. They remained hidden behind their dumpster, with
the police around them for protection, and other police
conferred on how to handle the situation, while still others
reinforced the line facing us. This went on for perhaps
fifteen minutes, until it was time for their rally to begin.
It continued for another fifteen minutes, and then another,
and then another, until we had succeeded in delaying their
rally by a full forty five minutes&#8212;no small achievement,
under the circumstances! By this time, our group was dispersed
within the much larger group of protesters that had gathered
at the corner, most clearly understanding that they were
delaying the rally by amassing there. Many were shouting
furiously at the police for being willing to defend such
opponents of liberty. The atmosphere was heated, to say
the least.</p>
<p>
It&#8217;s worth interrupting here to emphasize what a different
feeling it is to act for yourself with your companions in
a situation like this than it is simply to follow the dictates
of the police or some other authority. As frightening as
it was to struggle physically with armed police officers,
it was even more exhilarating to feel that we were acting
according to our consciences rather than out of fear or
conformity. That sensation, the feeling that your life really
is your own and anything is possible, that you experience
when you come to see the world around you as something negotiable
and engage with it deliberately, is one I wish everyone
could taste.</p>
<p>
In acting as a small, self-starting group, we had opened
up the option of militant resistance to many others, who
joined in enthusiastically; but the downside to this was
that our group lost coherence within the larger mass. Our
banners and banner holders had been separated from one another
in the chaos, and we never again that day formed a tight
nucleus. A city bus protected by police finally showed up
to collect the cowering fascists, and drove off in the opposite
direction with them inside. We received reports from our
scouts that it was headed to the opposite side of the rally
site, on the far side of the permitted zone from where we
were; we tried to move down towards it, but moving in any
even minimally organized manner through the assembled masses
around the narrow perimeter of the rally site proved impossible.
We didn&#8217;t want to move through the permitted zone
itself, anyway, so as not to draw heat to those seeking
safety there or interfere with their chosen form of protest.
This was the point at which individual actions by scattered
groups could have taken place to heighten the atmosphere
of uncertainty; whether any did is unknown, but certainly
not enough did. Best case scenario, we would have had others
ready to intercept the bus, but we had not prepared enough
for that.</p>
<p>
Surrounded by police, with us still hundreds of feet away,
the fascists were able to leave the bus without being assaulted
by anything more than the jeers of bystanders. Realizing
that we had at last failed to prevent them from reaching
the site, we changed our strategy: at this point our only
hope of stopping the rally was to create chaos that seemed
uncontrollable, so we attempted a full frontal offensive.
The police barring our path had been replaced by now with
officers in full body armor, and officers with tear gas
rifles and on horseback stood behind them. The great metal
fence was between us and them; it was composed of massively
heavy sections, almost inextricably linked together. Amazingly,
we were able to get one of the sections free, and pushed
forward with it and a couple of our own barricades against
the lines of police that immediately rushed to meet us.
This confrontation was much more pitched than the earlier
one had been; the police rained blows upon us, and we struck
back, lifting the visors of their helmets to even the odds
where necessary. One particularly aggressive officer lost
his head in the fray and found himself surrounded by us&#8212;his
colleagues had to snatch him over the fence to safety. It
was real pandemonium at times, when police and protesters
were mixed up and the lines between them became unclear;
I believe at one point I even saw a demonstrator make use
of a stage diving technique to get into the action! Once
again, those the police attempted to nab for arrests were
freed, but we failed to make much headway against their
lines. In the end, we lifted the section of metal fencing
over our heads and passed it to the back of the crowd, where
it was dropped into a pit at the foot of the building behind
us so it would not block further advances on our part. This
simple disposal of a large segment of the police barricade
was gratifying, at least, but it was clear we weren&#8217;t
prepared to break through their lines frontally.</p>
<p>
The fascist rally was in full swing, now, with the two dozen
of them who had made it out of the parking lot holding their
swastika flags and making their speeches, most of which
were drowned out by audience noise. The police had prohibited
even the few fascist sympathizers who had showed up from
passing through their lines, perhaps as a result of our
activities; it was only fascist would-be leaders, their
children, and the cameras of the mainstream media on the
site. Lacking other ideas as to how to interrupt the event,
some who had brought smoke bombs attempted to deploy one.
The plywood banners that were still in our possession proved
useful here; by holding them at waist height, up in the
air, some were able to obscure the vision of the police
ahead of us (though perhaps not of the rooftop snipers with
binoculars) while others attempted to light and throw the
smoke bomb. Under the circumstances this was imprudent at
best, though, since at that point there were many around
us who were not prepared for this level of risk. Some of
us, not sure how we felt about what was going on, took it
upon ourselves to form a buffer between the ones with the
smoke bomb and everyone else. The inexperienced individual
who attempted to hurl the smoke bomb once it was lit failed
to get it past the banners, and it was something of a debacle,
though no one was hurt (or scared, with the possible exception
of said individual). Moral of the story: as my friend&#8217;s
high school band teacher always told him, practice at home!</p>
<p>
Others among us took advantage of the sympathetic crowd
cover to paint the buildings behind us with small slogans
and artwork critical of fascism. Conversations took place,
as well: people asked why we were wearing masks, and were
generally understanding when we explained it was to avoid
being profiled by the police&#8212;and, for that matter,
the fascists, who were running surveillance of demonstrators
for their own purposes.</p>
<p>
Perhaps the only decidedly negative receptions any of us
experienced came from two of the organizers of the permitted
rally. One of them, a white man associated with the flagship
state university, had come up to us when we were engaged
in our standoff between the parking lot and the rally site,
suggesting that we cease our militant activity and join
the silent, passive protest in the permitted zone; he persisted
in insisting, providing no tactical rationale for why we
should give up the gains we had made at that point, until
one hotheaded young person finally asked if he was a police
officer. The other, somewhat less absurdly, asked the demonstrator
with the big drum to stop playing it in the proximity of
the permitted zone, on the grounds that it was drowning
out their silent protest; for a time, the drummer was silent,
out of respect for her request. Some tempers did flare in
the midst of the fray, it&#8217;s true, and it is possible
that others exchanged harsh words at some point during the
day. It&#8217;s very important that those of us who practice
direct action demonstrate the utmost in civility and sensitivity
in the process of doing so, so there will never be any question
about what part of our hearts such actions proceed from,
or whether direct action activists are generally welcoming
and responsible people.</p>
<p>
Well, back to the action. At this point, certain that we
were not going to succeed in actually shutting down the
rally, many of us made our way back up the perimeter towards
the parking lot, to enact plan B: go after their cars. At
the corner we had occupied before, we were met once again
with a line of police, and there was another skirmish, this
time involving mounted police as well. There were some blows
and angry words exchanged between police officers and protesters&#8212;the
latter now including a broad diversity of individuals, not
just the organized demographic that had initiated direct
action at the beginning of the event. Yet again, those the
police grabbed were pulled free, but our progress was blocked.
All the same, some individuals, moving stealthily outside
the mass, subsequently managed to circumvent the police
line and infiltrate the parking lot. The tires of a vehicle
belonging to a fascist skinhead were slashed, and some scuffling
and chasing ensued. The individuals involved managed to
get away, but the rest of us on the corner could have done
better to support them by making another charge at the police
line around this time to create a distraction.</p>
<p>
It was shortly afterwards that the day&#8217;s five arrests
took place; all five of them were the result of individuals
walking around apart from the masked bloc while still wearing
their masks. This made them obvious targets for police.
Clearly, we should have gone over that lesson more thoroughly
beforehand: wear your mask with the others in masks who
can protect you, change your appearance radically when you
leave their company. One individual&#8217;s collarbone was
broken in the process of the arrest, thanks to a policeman&#8217;s
overzealous tackling. All those arrested were bailed out
of jail by that night; an experienced civil rights lawyer
volunteered to take their cases gratis, and is currently
in the process of getting them through the legal system
with a minimum of hassles and repercussions.<br>
Realizing that our morale was waning, our numbers dwindling,
and the most dangerous period of the day approaching&#8212;when
the permitted protesters would disperse, leaving only us
and the police&#8212;we decided against attempting to assail
the fascists as they were returned to the parking lot. It
was time to quit while we were as ahead as we were going
to get, before any more arrests could be made. Those of
us in masks and sweatshirts melted into the larger crowd,
swiftly changing our clothing outside the view of the police,
and then made our way in ones and twos out of the area as
protesters from the permitted protest did the same. We suffered
no more arrests in this process; we had successfully delayed
the state-subsidized fascist rally, decorated the walls
of the state political district with politics of our own,
fought over a hundred fifty thoroughly equipped riot police,
and lived to tell the tale.</p>
<p>
Most mainstream media coverage of the event was deceitful,
to say the least. They drastically underestimated the number
of protesters, misrepresented the atmosphere by describing
people as practically being amenable to the fascist presence,
and made little to no mention of the way we delayed the
rally or the violence with which the police responded. The
fact that the mainstream cameras and reporters were the
only ones allowed inside the police lines with the fascists
was as telling as the spectacle many of us witnessed of
the police chief and the fascist top dog smiling and laughing
and chatting together behind the police lines.</p>
<p>
Underground and independent media coverage was much more
thorough and honest. Predictably, there was a post on a
website from the white guy from the university mentioned
above, arguing that although he understood the value of
diversity of tactics, this demonstration had not been the
appropriate time for direct action. Such a statement is
disingenuous; accepting diversity of tactics means recognizing
and respecting that others are going to make their own decisions
about tactics and act accordingly, not granting that diverse
approaches are acceptable &#8220;when I say so&#8221;! He
argued, essentially, that the most proper role of any counter-rally
demonstration was to involve the greatest possible number
of people, especially those most seriously affected by fascist
organizing&#8212;presumably assuming that non-confrontational
tactics are always the most popular, and that people of
color are the ones chiefly at risk from fascist organizing
(when, in fact, people of anarchist and queer orientations,
not to mention Jewish heritage, all of whom were present
in our number along with people of color, are also significantly
at risk from fascist activity). I would argue to the contrary
that there were at least one hundred people at the protest
that day, if not more, who went explicitly to confront the
fascists and their protectors, and who wouldn&#8217;t have
been there otherwise&#8212;that is to say, the best way
to involve the greatest number of people is for the broadest
possible array of approaches to be applied without interfering
with one another. For the most part, we took great care
to keep well away from the area reserved for the permitted
rally, and did a decent job of not hindering their chosen
approach. With the exception of this individual, and a clown
(yes, literally, a clown) the mainstream media found to
say that it was unfair that our noise was drowning out the
fascists&#8217; articulation of their ideas, few others
expressed disapproval of the way our actions interacted
with those of other protesters.</p>
<p>
After the smoke cleared, we met again to discuss what had
worked and what could have worked better. Spirits were generally
high. We had demonstrated the power of a few individuals
to come up with an idea, deploy it in the face of incredible
odds, and influence the course of events. Acting on our
own initiative, exploring our potential in practice, we
had taken on the assembled powers of the Ku Klux Klan, the
National Socialist Movement, and the state government, and
scored some significant victories. Our initial plan for
converging and setting the tone for the day&#8217;s had
worked, and had we had a little more experience, numbers,
or morale, we might well have shut the event down entirely.
Beyond this, we had all gotten to know one another much
better, and learned a lot about the amazing things we could
do together.</p>
<p>
Most of the necessary constructive criticism has been covered
above, but one point remains to be made. It&#8217;s important
that individuals participating in direct actions not go
any farther than they feel confident and comfortable doing;
if you get hurt or arrested or otherwise in trouble while
participating in a level of engagement for which you are
not emotionally prepared, the effects can be debilitating.
Far better that you get started slowly and conservatively,
building a sustainable involvement with direct action projects
that can continue over a lifetime, than rush into an action
with wild abandon, have a bad experience, and swear off
further participation in such actions. All but one of us
had a really empowering, fulfilling time preparing for and
engaging in this protest, and the one who came away from
it with a sour taste did so in part because he had not prepared
himself for the possible consequences of the lengths to
which he took his resistance that day. Let&#8217;s fight,
let&#8217;s run risks and push limits, but let&#8217;s do
so consciously and carefully, as part of a long-term process,
so the experiences we gain in so doing will not go to waste!</p>
