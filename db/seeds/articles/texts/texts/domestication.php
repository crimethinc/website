<h1>The Domestication of Animals . . .<br>
. . . and of Man</h1>
<h5>a crimethInc. special report</h5>
<p> Throughout the history of Western civilization the relationship of human
beings to other animals has never been particularly "civil." What was
once an uneasy coexistence swiftly became a relationship of domination
and exploitation as humankind became more organized and technologically
developed. In recent years, animal rights activists have brought international
attention to the treatment and living conditions of animals in factory
farms, zoos, circuses, and laboratories, but a serious discussion has
yet to begin about the lives of the animals that exist in an environment
that strikes much closer to home--the lives of domesticated animals, of
our own household pets. A consideration of the lives our pets must lead
reveals that they too are exploited in their relationship with human beings;
but more than that, it also reveals something to us about ourselves. </p>
<p> Certainly there are plenty of happy, well-adjusted domesticated animals
who manage to lead lives that are, for them, exciting and fulfilling.
Still, history shows us that human beings in the worst of conditions,
even during such periods of suffering and abomination as the Holocaust,
have often managed to enjoy life, to fall in love and forge friendships,
to find meaning in their day to day existence; for human beings are durable
and resilient, and like all animals will adapt as well as they can to
survive and thrive in any situation. So the fact that many animals--or
humans, for that matter--are happy in our homes is by no means adequate
reason to set aside a consideration of the merits of domesticated life.
</p>
<p> Let us consider the usual contents of the lives of today's domesticated
animals. Life begins, for most of them, in what we would refer to in human
terms as a "broken home." Young dogs and cats are routinely taken from
the company of their mothers and siblings at an extremely early age and
thrust into an alien environment, whether it be a crowded, chaotic pet
shop or the home of their new owner. Many of them are mistreated and abused
(it is not at all uncommon for a dog, housecat, or parrot to have a phobia
of human males, for many of them are abused by men in their youth), and
many more are orphaned. More often than not, when domesticated animals
reproduce it is looked upon as an unplanned inconvenience by their human
owners, and the unwanted offspring are treated accordingly. Consider how
difficult it is for young men and women who grow up in "broken homes,"
or in the adoption agency/youth reform program circuit, to become happy
and self-confident, and it will become clear how difficult growing up
must be for today's domesticated animals. </p>
<p> But a difficult childhood is the only the beginning of a difficult and
unnatural life for today's typical housecat, gerbil, or parrot. For not
only are the environments (i.e. cages, little glass boxes, six-room apartments
and houses with climate control, and--at best--suburban back yards with
the lawns mowed and bushes trimmed) which they must inhabit drastically
different from those for which nature prepared them, but their role in
the lives of the human beings who control their fate is itself unnatural.
Most human beings who keep animals regard them as if they were, in some
senses, toys rather than real animals. That seems like an unfair charge,
but consider the usual relationship of these humans and animals, and the
assumptions upon which the human owners keep these animals. Certainly
these owners try to provide for the animals' needs, and often offer affection,
but the fundamental role these animals play in the homes and lives of
these people is the role of entertainment (and, often, of surrogate family/friends
as well). That is, the animals are kept by the human beings in the expectation
that they will bring some sort of fun, and perhaps love, in their owners'
lives. Their role is not to be animals, that is, to hunt mice, to fly
south for the winter, to chase down elk, to sharpen their claws where
they please, to mark their territory with urine and court members of the
opposite sex. Rather, they are expected to be modern court jesters or
courtesans in the Western household. </p>
<p> The ramifications of this relationship between animals and humans are
many, but we can see that this arrangement is not exactly in the best
interest of the animals involved when we consider the "adjustments" human
beings customarily make to their pets to make these pets fulfill their
domestic roles more effectively. Housecats are the most obvious example:
their owners routinely declaw and sterilize them so they will better fulfill
their role as polite toys, rather than real animals, in the home. Having
and using claws is a pretty basic part of being a cat; a cat without claws
is like a human being without fingers: it may get used to the situation,
and even figure out how to enjoy life despite the alteration, but something
will be missing from its life forever. </p>
<p> Similarly, though some say that sterilization is humane and makes life
simpler for these animals, is this a simplification any of us would willingly
choose for ourselves? Sterilization affects more than just the sex lives
of animals; it changes their hormonal balance, changing their very personalities.
A sterilized cat will often gain weight, slow down, become less spirited.
Sterilized cats and dogs are easier for their owners to deal with in a
number of ways, but this must come at a cost to their enjoyment of life
itself. A frustrated female cat in heat may not seem to be enjoying life
very much, but if you take away a being's desires, what meaning is left
for it to find in life? Left with its natural inclinations either surgically
removed or frustrated by an environment much different than the one for
which nature designed it, the sterilized cat will often become dull, grouchy,
and fat--for eating the food its master provides is the only pleasure
left to it. </p>
<p> Most of us can quickly call to mind an overweight, pathetic, neurotic
dog or similarly maladjusted housepet that we have met at some time in
our lives. These animals are the casualties of the exploitative relationship
that exists today between humans and domesticated animals. Expected to
be content as mere playthings, to eat standardized pet food that comes
out of a box, and to live in quarters that are painfully cramped compared
to their natural environments, it should come as no surprise that these
animals are no longer as energetic or as passionate as wild animals. Once
healthy and self-sufficient in their natural environment, these animals
are now forced into humiliating dependence upon human beings who do not--cannot--permit
them to live the lives that they would find fulfilling. </p>
<p> This is not to say that there is any truly viable alternative to domestication
for these animals today. The "outside world" is no place for them to run
wild or reproduce in; their natural habitats, for those animals who could
still adapt back to them, have been changed beyond all recognition by
pollution and other forces. The emerging new global environment, pockmarked
by fields of asphalt, forests of steel, and cliffs of concrete, is only
hospitable to pigeons and cockroaches. Compared to life in the "outside
world," domesticated life is a lesser of two evils for housecats and parakeets
alike. </p>
<p> And this is what is most tragic about this situation: there is no way
out of the technological, over-organized world we have created; no way
out for animals or humans. For we are really not much different from the
animals we keep in cages and fishtanks in our homes: We too live in small,
climate-controlled boxes, called apartments. We too buy standardized food
to eat at McDonalds, food much different from the food our ancestors had
evolved to eat. We too can find no outlet for our spontaneous, "wild"
urges, castrated and declawed as we are by the necessities of living in
cramped cities and suburbs under cramping legal and cultural restrictions.
We too cannot wander far from our kennels, leashed as we are by 9-to-5
jobs, by apartment leases, even by political boundaries. And if we did
wander far, what would we find? Forests, jungles, wild plains, majestic
canyons? These are swiftly disappearing as we work around the clock to
wrap our world in a skin of concrete, to make sure that all the grass
is watered by sprinklers and all the swamps are drained and surveyed to
be turned into office space. And what we don't transform into bigger cages
and fishtanks for ourselves, we will surely make useless with pollution,
if we do not reconsider and redirect our actions on a massive scale. </p>
<p> Perhaps we can learn about ourselves from the example of our own pets.
We might do well to learn from them that real happiness does not follow
from merely providing for food, physical health, and safety, but from
much more complicated elements of life. The solution to the problem of
the emotional poverty of domesticated life for animals, and for humans,
is clearly not a simple one. We must begin by reevaluating what life should
be for humans and animals alike, and what our society must be so that
our lives can be meaningful and fulfilling. And we do not have too much
time to waste; for already we have bred dogs that do not know how to survive
without leashes, and soon there may not be any going back for us either.

and four-legged cousins; you have done it to yourselves. You have changed
men into chairmen of boards, into office workers, into time-clock punchers.
You have changed your women into housewives, truly fearful creatures.
I was once invited to the house of one. 'Watch the ashes, don't smoke,
you'll stain the curtains. Watch the goldfish bowl, don't lean your head
against the wallpaper; your hair may be greasy. Don't spill liquor on
that table: it has a delicate finish. You should have wiped your boots;
the floor was just varnished. Don't don't don't' That is crazy. You live
in prisons you have built for yourselves, calling them 'homes, offices,
factories.'" </i> </p>
