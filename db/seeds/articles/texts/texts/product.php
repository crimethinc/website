<h1>Product is the  Excrement of Action</h1>
<h6>by Jeanette Winterson </h6>
<p> <i>Honestly, when was the last time you spent a whole day just enjoying
what you were doing and feeling? Enjoying it solely for its own sake,
without thinking about the future or worrying about the long-term consequences?
When was the last time you spent a whole month living that way? Do you
have a hard time forgetting about your responsibilities, your goals, your
productivity, and just being in the present? </i></p>
<p> Today, our lives revolve around things. We measure our worth in terms
of our material possessions: in terms of our control over things outside
ourselves. We gauge our success in life in terms of our "productivity";
that is, our ability to make these things. Our social system revolves
around the production and consumption of material goods more than anything
else. Even when we are not thinking about material objects, we represent
our lives to ourselves as things: we consider our accomplishments, our
future prospects, our social position... anything but how we actually
feel. "The end justifies the means," we say; that is, the products of
our actions, the end results of our lives, are more important to us than
the process of living itself. </p>
<p> But products are the excrement of actions. Product is what is left over
when the dust settles and the pulse returns to normal, when the day is
done, when the coffin is laid in the ground. We do not exist in the settling
dust or the scorecard; we are here in the present tense, in the making,
the doing, the feeling. Just as we try to immortalize ourselves by fleeing
into the world of fixed, deathless images, we try to externalize ourselves
by thinking in terms of the results of our actions rather than our experience
of the actions themselves. After all, it's so complicated to have to worry
about whether you are really enjoying yourself, how you are feeling in
the moment. It is easier to focus on the results, the hard evidence of
your life; these things seem easier to understand, and easier to control.
</p>
<p> Modern society is centered around the production and distribution of
material goods, rather than the happiness and satisfaction of its participants.
thus Modern man thinks of his life in terms of what he has "to show for
it," rather than considering the life itself. </p>
<p> Of course today's average worker is used to thinking about the ends
rather than the means. He spends most of his time and energy working at
a job that in all likelihood does not fulfill his dreams. He looks forward
to payday every two weeks, for he counts on his paycheck to make sense
out of his life: without it, he would feel like he was wasting his time.
If he didn't look at the "consequences" of his actions as a justification
for them, life would be unbearable-what if he constantly considered how
he was feeling as he bagged groceries, or asked himself if he was having
fun every moment he struggled with the fax machine? Insofar as his everyday
experience of life is tedious and meaningless, he needs to concentrate
on the coming weekend, the next vacation, his next purchases, to fend
off insanity. And eventually he is bound to generalize that mode of thinking
to other parts of his life: he comes to evaluate possible actions according
to the rewards they offer, just as he would evaluate a job according to
the wage it offers. </p>
<p> Thus, the present has lost almost all significance for modern man. Instead
he spends his life always planning for the future: he studies for a diploma,
rather than for the pleasure of learning; he chooses his job for social
status, wealth, and "security," rather than for joy; he saves his money
for big purchases and vacation trips, rather than to buy his way out of
wage slavery and into full time freedom. When he finds himself experiencing
profound happiness with another human being, he tries to freeze that moment,
to turn it into a permanent fixture (a contract), by marrying her. On
Sundays he goes to church, where he is told to do good deeds in order
to one day receive eternal salvation (as NietzsChe says, the good Christian
still wants to be paid well), rather than for the sheer pleasure of helping
others. The "aristocratic disregard for consequences," that ability to
act for the sake of action that every hero possesses, is far beyond him.
</p>
<p> It is a cliche that men and women of middle class and middle age have
a hard time putting aside their insurance policies and investment programs
to seize the moment; but, all too often, we, too, end up exchanging present
for future and experience for souvenirs. We save mementos, trophies, boxes
of keepsakes, old letters, as if life can be gathered, stored up, frozen
for later... for later? For when? Life is here with us now, running through
us like a river; and like a river, it cannot be held in place without
losing its magic. The more time we spend trying to "save it up," the less
we have to throw ourselves into it. </p>
<p> The worst of us, in fact, are the radicals and artists. All too often,
we "revolutionaries" expend our efforts thinking and talking about a revolution
"that is to come," rather than concentrating on making revolution in the
present tense. We're so used to thinking in terms of production that even
when we try to make life into something immediate and exciting, we still
end up centering our efforts around an event in the future-one that we
may not even live to see. And like factory supervisors, we worry more
about our productivity (the number of new believers recruited, the progress
of the "cause," etc.) than about how we and our fellow human beings are
feeling and living. Artists suffer from this tendency most of all; for
their vocation itself depends on making products out of the raw material
of real-life experience. There is something of the capitalist's lust for
domination in the way that artists mold their emotions and experiences
into forms of their own making through the act of expression; for the
expression of feelings and sensations, unique and unfathomable as they
are, always consists of a kind of simplification. It isn't enough for
the artist to just experience and appreciate life as it really is; she
comes to cannibalize her life for what is really a career, a series of
products outside herself, even adjusting her life for her career's sake.
Worse, she may find that she cannot make love on a rooftop at daybreak
without planning out the excellent scene for her novel (excrement!) that
this will make for. </p>
<p> Certainly, excretion is a healthy and necessary function of the soul
as well as the body, and there is a place for art in our lives as a way
to pour feeling back into the world when the heart is full to overflowing;
but if you keep trying to do it after it is unnecessary, you eventually
force out your heart and the rest of your insides (remember the fairy
tale of the goose and the golden eggs?). We must put life and experience
first, we must meet the world with only this in mind, as fresh and innocent
as when we were children, with no intentions to cannibalize, categorize,
organize, or simplify the profound infinities of our experiences. Otherwise,
we will miss what is most vital, most beautiful, most immediate in this
world, in our search for things that can be pressed flat and preserved
"for all time." Imagination should be used first and foremost to transform
everyday reality, not just to make symbolic representations of it. How
many exciting novels could be written about the sort of lives that most
of us lead these days, anyway?. Let us make living our art, rather than
seeking to make mere art out of our lives. </p>
<p> If we ever find happiness, it will be in the process of living, of doing
what we want and living out our dreams, not in the products of our lives.
If we don't pause and enjoy the present now, when will we? So let's stop
"making history"-we're all so obsessed with "making a mark"-and start
living. That would be a real revolution. Let's live for today, for our
lives, not our "results"! </p>
<p> <i>"Sometimes," said Julia, "I feel the past and the future pressing
so hard on either side that there's no room for the present at all." "But
I tell you, Henri, that every moment you steal from the present is a moment
that you have lost forever. There's only now." </i></p>
