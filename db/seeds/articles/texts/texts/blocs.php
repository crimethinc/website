<h1>Blocs,
Black and Otherwise</h1>
<p><em>As one middle-aged mother observed while members of
the Quebec Black Bloc hugged each other before going off

<h4>Materials:</h4>
<li>Matching clothing that conceals the wearers&#8217; identities<br>
<li>Trust and communication<br>
<li>A mission</li>
<h4>
Optional Materials:</h4>
<li>Provisions: water (plenty, especially if you&#8217;ll
be dressed in hot gear or expect chemical weapons attacks),
food (don&#8217;t rely on shops or shopkeepers in contested
zones), etc.<br>
<li>Camouflage: different layers of clothing for different
purposes or stages of the action<br>
<li>Defensive gear: banners, shields (possibly disguised as
puppets or placards), steel-toed shoes (should still be
comfortable for running!), body armor or padding, gas masks
or goggles and bandannas soaked in lime juice (store in
ziplock bags until necessary), rain coats or chemical protection
gear (if there is a risk of chemical attack), whatever relevant
medical supplies you know how to apply, etc<br>
<li>Offensive gear: spraypaint, projectiles, slingshots, signs
or flags on thick poles (or just plain poles), molotov cocktails,
bright lights (to obscure police or camera vision during
night actions), ladders and/or bolt cutters for scaling
or breaching barriers, etc.<br>
<li>Communications equipment: hand radios, cell phones, police
scanners, flags, drums, shared codes for making internal
announcements<br>
<li>Transportation: bicycles, enough change for the subway,
keys to your SUV (easy there, killer, it&#8217;s just a
joke!)</li>

<h3 style="padding-top: 2px">What is a Bloc? Are there other kinds
besides the Black Bloc?</h3>
<p> You
may have heard of the notorious Black Bloc, a venerable,
if not doddering, anarchist tradition in which a mass of
direct action enthusiasts gather, all wearing black clothing
and masks, and engage in some level of illegal activity.
This tactic has won some famous victories in the past couple
decades, and failed utterly more times than anyone can count,
too. The specific cultural characteristics that are associated
with the Black Bloc tactic today can make it easy to overlook
the long history of the Bloc tactic and the wide variety
of applications for which it can be used. The Boston Tea
Party, for example, was a perfect example of a Bloc at work:
the participants organized secretly, wore matching disguises
(though their choice to costume themselves as &#8220;Indians&#8221;
wasn&#8217;t exactly politically correct), and engaged in
a mass act of provocative property destruction; presumably
their strategies for communication and mutual defense weren&#8217;t
much different from those used by the famous Black Blocs
that, a couple hundred years later, attacked similarly noxious
coffee corporations in Seattle. Those who practice direct
action would do well to keep in mind the wide range of scenarios
in which a version of the Bloc approach can be useful.<br>
</p>
<h3>What
is a Bloc good for?</h3>
<p> Acting
in a Bloc is especially useful when some of the participants
in the action expect they may break laws. When everyone
in a group looks the same, it is difficult for the police
or others to tell who did what. Most criminal activities
are better carried off in a less obvious manner, of course,
but there are situations in which it is necessary to step
outside the limits in public. The Bloc tactic as it&#8217;s
known these days is best for conditions in which the action
called for occupies the grey area between overt and covert,
and as such it must be applied carefully: if you participate
with a Bloc in an entirely legal action, you may make a
police target of yourself unnecessarily, or needlessly frighten
bystanders; on the other hand, if you intend to engage in
serious organized criminal activity, you might be better
off doing so outside the traditional Bloc format, in a totally
closed group, with the element of surprise and so on. It&#8217;s
not a coincidence that people don&#8217;t liberate animals
from fur factories in Black Blocs.</p>
<p> One
of the positive sides of public Bloc activity is that, unlike
entirely underground activity, it can create open-ended
situations, in which the actions of a few can open the floodgates
for others to join in. One of the many objectionable qualities
of terrorism is that, at best, it is still a spectator sport;
a Bloc, on the other hand, can be a participatory and contagious
radicalizing experience. The most obvious way to facilitate
this is to organize an open or semi-open Bloc. In an open
Bloc, a general call goes out to all interested to gather
and act in a Bloc; open meetings are held to discuss goals,
strategies, and so on. The benefits of such an approach
are that more people can be involved; the obvious drawback
is that security is so compromised that the possibilities
for action are severely limited. In a semi-open Bloc, the
organizing takes place in secret, between people who know
and trust each other, but when the Bloc itself comes together,
others in Bloc attire are welcomed to it; in the past few
years of Black Bloc activities, this has been the most frequent
format. In such Blocs, it is still necessary that the participants
be prepared to deal with infiltration, but they at least
have the benefit of secure planning and internal structures.
In an entirely closed Bloc, the participants prepare in
secret and do not welcome the participation or company of
any outsiders during the action. Even when such a Bloc is
called for, it can still be valuable to act openly, as a
Bloc, rather than covertly: the public nature of the action
may send an important message, others outside the Bloc may
be inspired to engage in similar actions of their own, the
crowd cover itself might enable an escape that would be
more difficult for those opting for a clandestine approach.</p>
<p> Besides
getting away with public criminal acts, there are other
reasons to act in a Bloc. Bloc participation can be really
exciting, and good for morale&#8212;acting in a mass of
people who are ostensibly prepared to do what they believe
is right regardless of police intimidation is often a hell
of a lot more empowering than chanting weakly with the liberals,
and matching battle-dress is a ritual for inspiring courage
that need not be abandoned to our uniformed enemies. A Bloc
presence may convey important information: to the powers
that be, don&#8217;t fuck with this march, or don&#8217;t
you dare rig that jury; to allies or possible allies, don&#8217;t
despair, we&#8217;re with you. Finally, anonymity: there
are countless reasons to conceal your identity at mass actions.
Even if you do not plan on committing any crimes, even if
you don&#8217;t mind the secret service capturing your image
for their files, you still do a great service to others
by masking up and increasing the number of people who are
disguised, thus making it more difficult for the police
to keep up with all of you. Those others might not just
be criminals, either; they might be foreigners who don&#8217;t
want their participation in radical activities to be used
as grounds for deportation, or teachers who don&#8217;t
want to risk losing their jobs. Sometimes a masked crowd
is unnecessarily intimidating to the public; sometimes few
enough people are masking up, or police attention is so
focused on the Bloc, that you may deem it safer not to draw
attention to yourself by doing so, even if you may engage
in illegal activities; and sometimes it&#8217;s better to
show your neighbors where you stand, or let the public and
the cameras see that not everyone involved in radical activity
is young, white, and male. Otherwise, if others are masking
up, you might as well do the same.</p>
<p> Those
masks don&#8217;t necessarily have to be black ski masks,
anyway; there are plenty of more fun, family-oriented ways
to obscure your identity. Beyond the Black Bloc, endless
possibilities open up: pink Blocs, clown Blocs, doctor Blocs,
maintenance worker Blocs&#8230; Wherever there are a bunch
of people wearing either identical clothing or costumes,
the Bloc tactic could be deployed utilizing the matching
crowd for camouflage. Halloween, for example, could offer
a great opportunity for Bloc action&#8212;as could a high
school graduation!<em><strong><br>
</strong></em></p>
<h3>Where and how can the Bloc tactic be applied?</h3>
<p> Black
Bloc actions have been a hit at mass actions over the past
couple decades: there have been Blocs in the protests at
meetings of such despicable gangs as the World Trade Organization,
at political events such as debates between presidential
candidates, at anti-war demonstrations and solidarity marches
with communities that are suffering police brutality. Wherever
there is a mass gathering of protesters, it may make sense
to deploy or call for a Bloc.</p>
<p> In
such environments, the Bloc can serve many purposes. As
mentioned before, it can simply be present as a promise
of solidarity, or a threat. It can act as a line of defense
for or a distraction from other activists doing civil disobedience
actions such as lock-downs and blockades, who will be unable
to defend themselves from the police. It can engage in property
destruction: this can achieve economic ends, such as inflicting
financial losses upon wicked corporations, or other practical
goals: a city can be persuaded never to risk hosting another
fill-in-the-blank, or alienated workers (and even activists!)
can experience firsthand that the stranglehold their oppressors
seem to have on reality can literally be broken. A Bloc
can attempt to prevent delegates from reaching an unwanted
meeting, or trap them inside the meeting space to make sure
they get the message that their shenanigans are not welcome.
It can reclaim urban space, opening up and protecting a
street or park for others to reinterpret and enjoy, or rerouting
a permitted march into unpermitted areas. It can engage
the police in conflict, and thus disrupt business as usual&#8212;a
meeting in Quebec City to discuss the Free Trade Area of
the Americas agreement had to be halted temporarily when
tear gas from the streetfighting below entered the vents
of the building hosting it. It can offer the possibility
of contesting power and control in immediate actions, rather
than mere words, and thus keep spirits up and appetites
whetted. A Bloc might attempt to set off full-scale rioting,
in hope of precipitating an insurrection&#8212;or it could
simply create a spectacle, to emphasize the anarchist presence
and foreground its romantic appeal: liberal carping about
&#8220;alienating the public&#8221; notwithstanding, the
Black Blocs in Seattle and afterwards did as much to increase
the mass appeal of anarchist action as any propaganda publication
ever has. If nothing else, a Bloc action can be good practice
for future such actions that may achieve more.</p>
<p> When
choosing goals for a Bloc at a mass action, it is critical
that the intentions, needs, and comfort levels of locals
and others who will be involved or present be taken into
account. Alienating people needlessly is not only counterproductive,
but endangers Bloc participants; the police are already
enough enemies for anyone breaking the law. The last thing
you want to do is endanger others with your actions&#8212;don&#8217;t
throw stones at the police from the back of a crowd, don&#8217;t
risk provoking police attacks on peaceful marches, especially
if you&#8217;re not planning on sticking around to bear
the brunt of them. If you&#8217;re operating in a mostly
out-of-town group that will be acting in a residential neighborhood,
don&#8217;t be so arrogant as to think you should be the
ones to decide what level of conflict is most appropriate
for the situation&#8212;far better you show that you respect
the needs and perspectives of the locals, and are willing
to follow their lead. There may be cases in which it is
appropriate to bring a level of intensity to an action that
others aren&#8217;t prepared to&#8212;for example, if liberal
organizers are addressing a gross injustice with useless
gestures that will do nothing to put things right&#8212;but
it&#8217;s good form to make sure that the first ones to
pay the piper for whatever goes down will be you and your
companions, not innocent bystanders.</p>
<p> Similarly,
it is important to be realistic about what you can hope
to accomplish in the situation at hand, given your experience,
numbers, and other resources. If the local populace hates
the arrogance of the leaders who are meeting in their city,
but mistrusts the equally foreign hordes who have gathered
there to protest them, it might make more sense to target
those leaders than to smash corporate windows in what the
locals might perceive as an outsiders&#8217; attack on their
home streets. Take everything into account: the personality
of the police force, the current local political climate,
how aware others will be of what happens to you and your
companions, whether the authorities will want to teach you
a lesson this time or avoid inopportune media coverage,
whether the police will be trying to secure the whole area
(in which case you can expect them to attempt mass arrests,
if they have the numbers) or simply protect a part of it
(in which case they may resort to dispersal or defense tactics,
if they are outnumbered or uncertain). Is your action intended
for media coverage, for those who witness it in person,
for those who participate in it, or for those who foot the
bills? Is your goal worth the risk, is it appropriate to
the event in question?</p>
<p> Outside
the mass at mass actions, acting in a Bloc is a much riskier
proposition, for the Bloc can be easily surrounded and neutralized
by the police. Historically, at demonstrations, almost every
Bloc that has mixed well with a much larger mass of law-abiding
protesters has managed to maintain some degree of safety
and coherence, while almost every Bloc that has attempted
to operate in their absence has suffered or at least risked
serious police repression. Some lessons we can draw from
such previous successes and failures are:</p>
<p> 1.
The Bloc should not operate without either the element of
surprise or the benefit of broad crowd cover, at least not
unless it is expected to be of vast numbers, high morale,
and great defensive experience, or unless the purpose of
the action is to get a lot of participants arrested.</p>
<p> 2.
Announced direct actions (Blocs, unpermitted marches, etc.)
at mass events should always take place on or before the
big day of general protest, never after them. When direct
action precedes or coincides with massive marches and gatherings,
it often sets the tone for everything that follows, upping
the ante and radicalizing the event in general; when direct
action enthusiasts are the only ones left out on the street
after the law-abiding activists have gone home, the police
know they can isolate, abuse, and arrest them without fear
of stepping on the toes of the &#8220;wrong&#8221; citizens,
or being observed by such citizens as they do so. The presence
of others who would witness police brutality is an important
deterrent; work without it at your peril.</p>
<p> 3.
Those operating in a Bloc need to have the support or at
least the respect of some, if not most, of those outside
the Bloc, so as to ensure their safety on the field, let
alone general good will in the activist community. In one
historic instance, a Black Bloc was surrounded and cornered
by police, who were moving in to finish it off when a march
organized by a liberal women&#8217;s organization was re-routed
to pass through the area and provide members of the Bloc
with an opportunity to blend in and escape. To this end,
it helps a great deal if the goals or targets of the Bloc
are instantly comprehensible to outsiders, so whether or
not others agree with the tactic itself they can at least
understand why it is being employed.</p>
<p> On
the other hand, there are cases in which none of these rules
of thumb is relevant. Entirely outside the realm of mass
actions, as long as the element of surprise is present,
there are many other environments in which the Bloc tactic
can be applied; indeed, such applications may be the most
promising for the future of the Bloc, now that police are
very familiar with and prepared for Bloc presence at demonstrations.
A Bloc operating swiftly and with the element of surprise
against an unsuspecting target can accomplish a great deal,
especially if it is of decent size. Consult the illustration
at the end of this text for an example of how a Bloc can
be deployed outside the demonstration format to wreak havoc
on corporate and governmental property.</p>
<p> When
acting in a Bloc with no demonstrating mass for cover, the
most important advantage you have to work with is surprise.
If you organize in such a way that the authorities in question
don&#8217;t see your action coming, you may be able to get
everything done and escape before they&#8217;re able to
respond. Even when they do arrive, chances are they will
not be prepared to make mass arrests, so you can expect
them to attempt only to seize individuals; in this situation,
the individuals carrying out high risk actions may be able
to disappear in the commotion (enthusiasts of civil disobedience
could even snarl the police up in petty arrests to facilitate
this, though they might thus risk a conspiracy charge if
they were connected to the Bloc)&#8212;or, if the group
is able to act with a high degree of solidarity and audacity,
staying close together and not permitting police to get
their hands on individuals within it, it might be possible
to negotiate a departure en masse, though you can expect
to be followed at the very least. It has happened before
that groups of activists breaking the law together, who
showed that they would not be intimidated nor allow members
to be picked off, have been permitted by unprepared police
to leave an area in return for concluding their action.
It&#8217;s also happened that they&#8217;ve had rubber bullets
shot at them, though! If some of you are planning illegal
activity of a serious nature, it may be a good idea to have
others in your group applying a wide range of less confrontational
tactics, so the police won&#8217;t be as likely to treat
you all as hard-core criminals . Always be sure everyone
in your group, especially the ones who aren&#8217;t keen
on taking great legal risks, knows exactly what the highest
level of possible illegal activity is in advance, as you
never know whether the police will choose to hold others
responsible for the actions of those they couldn&#8217;t
catch!</p>
<p> If
you&#8217;re showing up at a corporate office at sunrise,
you can expect to be practically the only ones there, and
you&#8217;ll have to count on speed and clever escape routes
for your liberty; but there are other situations in which,
just as at a demonstration, there will be crowd cover&#8212;even
potentially supportive crowd cover&#8212;to melt into. Who
knows, a Sports Fan Bloc mixing with the jubilant crowd
celebrating a home team football victory might be able to
touch off hard-core anti-corporate vandalism and looting!</p>
<p> When
making plans and setting goals for a Bloc action in a particular
context, it is always important to look back in history
for precedents. If the last time someone tried something
similar to what you are trying was a disaster, you had better
figure out what new element you can throw in to give yourself
a better chance. History tends to repeat itself&#8212;at
least when we don&#8217;t use our ingenuity to derail it!
Get familiar with the history of Bloc actions over the past
few years; whenever you&#8217;re considering joining in
one, pick out and consider the previous example that best
indicates what you can expect from this one&#8212;keeping
in mind, of course, that your adversaries have been doing
the same, so counting on a particular stratagem to work
twice is a risky proposition. It is at least as important
to know when not to do a Bloc action as it is to know when
to try one: unsuccessful attempts to act in Bloc, when there
are not enough participants available or the conditions
are not favorable, can sap energy better applied elsewhere.
When you strike in Bloc, strike hard and impressively, then
wait for the next realistic chance to do so again.</p>
<h3>Structure</h3>
<p> Naturally,
the affinity group is the basic building block of any Bloc.
It is impossible to overstate the importance of engaging
in Bloc activity as part of a small group capable of fending
for itself and making decisions; to do otherwise is to abdicate
responsibility for yourself to the mass, and to deny that
mass the benefit of your participation as an equal. Blocs
made up of self-sufficient affinity groups can make democratic
decisions quickly, can split up into equally effective smaller
groups, can handle stressful situations without the added
stress of herding a flock of confused followers. It goes
without saying that within your affinity group, you should
establish common expectations about what goals are, what
level of risk is acceptable, what kind of security is appropriate.
Security is especially important in Bloc activities, because
of the sketchy mix of public and unlawful activity that
may be involved; be sure everyone has the same sense of
security culture.</p>
<p> Regardless
of the total size of the Bloc, each affinity group should
be totally self-sustaining, at least in regards to the goals
it intends to achieve. Escape routes, legal resources, emergency
backup plans, knowledge of the area&#8212;every affinity
group should have all of these. A buddy system inside a
group is useful, so if the group itself is dispersed individuals
can take responsibility for the safety and whereabouts of
their partners. Internal roles can be assigned: for example,
scouts who keep track of activity and police presence (these
can be equipped with hand radios or cell phones with which
to communicate with the main group, and can ride bicycles
for extra speed and mobility; it usually makes the most
sense to position them a block or so away from the group,
so they can provide early warnings and broader perspective
on the area), communications people (also with radios or
cell phones, and perhaps a police scanner) to exchange information
with the scouts and other groups, runners to communicate
new information to nearby groups, experienced folks to correlate
and consider information and take responsibility for making
split-second decisions, persons to actually carry out the
actions planned, lookouts to cover them, perhaps a flag-bearer
or marching band to maintain morale and keep the group visible
from a distance, and so on. It might be wise to have one
person in non-Bloc clothing to attend the Bloc, to handle
such tasks as explaining to spectators that they should
not take photographs, for the police can seize their cameras
and use the pictures in court. The role the affinity group
plays in a larger group can also be specialized: an affinity
group could serve as scouts for a larger Bloc, or set out
to blockade a particular intersection, or concentrate on
maintaining a banner at the front of a large group.</p>
<p> An
affinity group can form a small, ad-hoc Bloc on its own,
but a larger, more powerful Bloc can be formed as a cluster
of affinity groups. In this case, it is critical that efficient
and democratic structures be set up within the cluster.
It should be possible for news, questions, and answers to
be communicated swiftly between individuals within affinity
groups and between affinity groups themselves, in even the
tensest of situations. Some have argued in favor of a more
militaristic Bloc model, that would presumably operate more
like the hierarchical regiments our enemies pit against
us, but the very strength of the Bloc is its decentralized,
unpredictable nature; it seems foolish to try to beat our
oppressors at their own game rather than capitalizing on
our own strengths. Better we improve our coordination, rather
than control: we are conductors setting the stage for improvisation,
not military tacticians with underlings and commanding officers.</p>
<p> In
a Bloc made up of affinity groups from different areas,
the local group will inevitably have the most information
about what is possible, and may well consequently have done
the most thinking and preparing. This is not necessarily
a problem, as long as others trust them and are organized
enough themselves to retain their autonomy. The local group
should make provisions for sharing as much information with
others as is safe, and also be sure not to assume unthinkingly
a position of authority over the other groups; a local group
attempting to lead an uninformed mass on an unrevealed secret
mission can be a real recipe for disaster.</p>
<h3>Preparation</h3>
<p> One
of the most important things to do before an action is learn
the area. As many members of each group as possible should
spend time traversing it, taking careful note of escape
routes and dead ends, cameras, places the police may mass
or seek to protect, possible targets, possible resources
(barricading materials such as moveable fences, etc.), and
above all making sure they will not get lost. Those who
cannot be there in advance should at least memorize maps.
It is possible to get aerial maps off the internet, for
locations for which street maps are unavailable or do not
suffice.</p>
<p> Make
sure you have safe accommodations before the action, if
there&#8217;s any chance the police are expecting it. Far
too many times, the police have raided activist housing
before an action and arrested hundreds of people; do everything
you can to find a place to sleep and prepare that is off
their radar, so you won&#8217;t run that risk. Stay with
a friend of your uncle, or rent sleeping space at a YMCA.
Don&#8217;t be stuck trying to sleep in your car on the
streets they&#8217;re patrolling in preparation for the
next day&#8217;s riot! If you&#8217;re from out of town,
make equally sure your traveling group (which may not be
the same as your affinity group) has planned a safe regrouping
and departure from the area, and has a backup plan in case
of emergency. Keep in mind that if things really go off,
certain parts of the city may be closed off to you after
the action, so you&#8217;ll need to regroup elsewhere.</p>
<p> Advance
meetings are a critical part of the preparation for most
Blocs. Again, how secure or public these meetings are will
depend on how many people (and with what level of direct
action experience) you hope to involve, and what degree
of legal risk you&#8217;re willing to take. If you&#8217;re
trying to organize a massive but largely symbolic open Bloc,
you might choose to circulate meeting times openly; if you&#8217;re
organizing the core of a Bloc that will be open in the street
but needs some preparation in private, tell others you trust
to pass on an invitation to the meeting only to those they
trust; if you&#8217;re preparing an entirely closed Bloc,
not only should you only reveal the time and place of the
meeting to your companions in the action, but you should
also make sure they all know not to mention the existence
of the project itself to anyone, and to have alibis ready
so their other friends won&#8217;t wonder what they&#8217;re
up to.</p>
<p> Meeting
location is an important factor in security. You don&#8217;t
want a place that can be monitored (no private residences),
you don&#8217;t want a place where you can be observed all
together (not the park across from the site of the next
day&#8217;s actions), you don&#8217;t want a place where
you can be seen entering and leaving or that someone could
enter unexpectedly&#8212;post scouts, lock the door once
things get started, watch out for anything suspicious. I&#8217;ll
never forget exiting an ultra-high security meeting in a
university basement only to discover that while we&#8217;d
been locked in, a crowd of liberal student protestors had
flooded the adjoining room to watch a slideshow&#8212;which
all the organizers of the next day&#8217;s militant Black
Bloc had to wade through in embarrassment! Oops! Small groups
can take walks and chat; larger groups can meet in quiet
outdoor settings&#8212;go hiking or camping, if there&#8217;s
time&#8212;or in private rooms in public buildings, such
as library study rooms or empty classrooms. Best case scenario:
though he has no idea you&#8217;re involved in direct action,
you&#8217;re close with the old guy who runs the caf&eacute;
across town, and he doesn&#8217;t mind letting you have
the back room one afternoon for a private party, no questions
asked.</p>
<p> Once
everyone is together, if the folks in attendance do not
all know each other already you can establish the level
of security by playing the &#8220;vouched for&#8221; game:
each person puts a hand on someone else present they know
and trust. Hopefully, everyone in the room will be touching,
through one connection or another, and the meeting can begin
with some degree of confidence in the air.</p>
<p> If
you are part of an affinity group participating in a larger
Bloc, you&#8217;ll want to have your own meetings first,
so when a representative of your group attends the larger
meeting she can present the information you have, the resources
you have to offer, the goals you hope to achieve, and the
plans you propose, according to how much of this you trust
a larger number of people to know. If this is a mass action
and there is a larger spokescouncil meeting taking place,
at least one person from the Bloc or in communication with
it should attend; it may or may not be safe for this person
to identify herself as such, but she should at least be
there to take note of what else is going on. A representative
of the Bloc could attend the spokescouncil presenting herself
as a part of an affinity group hoping to do support for
those involved in Bloc activity, and thus test the waters
or even meet others interested in the Bloc.</p>
<p> In
the meetings with your affinity group and the Bloc, you&#8217;ll
want to establish a plan of some kind for the day (these
almost never come off as intended, but they help to get
everyone in practice thinking about the situation, and it&#8217;s
good to be prepared to have something to do in case everything
does work out), and a structure to facilitate the Bloc communicating
and making quick, democratic decisions, as described above.
Structure will make you adaptable and thus effective, whether
or not your plans come to fruition. You should establish
a meeting point for the Bloc, plans for dispersal, and a
possible time and place for regrouping, if that would be
desirable should the Bloc be divided early. Share legal
information, what resources will be available for those
who are arrested. Go over every possible scenario, what
you can expect from each other in each of them. Psychology
is important here: plan for the worst, but don&#8217;t demoralize
yourselves&#8212;you&#8217;re considering the possible problems
so you&#8217;ll be ready for them, not to talk yourself
out of action.</p>
<p> Finally&#8212;if
there will be more than one language spoken among demonstrators
or locals, make sure to learn a few important phrases in
each of them: &#8220;we are not against you, we want no
trouble with you,&#8221; &#8220;don&#8217;t run, walk!&#8221;
&#8220;medical assistance needed!&#8221;</p>
<h3>During the action</h3>
<p> It
is often wise to write the phone number of a legal contact
on your body in permanent marker shortly before an action,
so you can be sure it will be available to you if you are
arrested, regardless of what else transpires. You may need
to know other cell phone numbers and so on for the day&#8217;s
actions: try to learn them by heart, or, failing that, write
them on your skin in an ink that you can rub off if absolutely
necessary. You&#8217;ll also want to have enough money on
you for food, transportation, and phone calls, but no more,
as that would probably disappear in the event of arrest.
Remove piercings that could be torn out. Do not carry your
address book, or unnecessary anarchist propaganda, or anything
needlessly incriminating or illegal; take your I.D. with
you if you want to be processed as your &#8220;true&#8221;
identity in the event of arrest, make sure you have no identifying
papers on you if you plan on withholding your identity from
the police in that event. Carry plenty of water and high-energy
foods with you; be prepared for emergencies&#8212;if you
get separated from everyone and have to spend the night
hiding out in a dumpster, you don&#8217;t want to be starving
too&#8212;but don&#8217;t weigh yourself down with anything
unnecessary. Carry with you whatever first aid supplies
you know how to use that might be useful. Be aware of what
medical assistance&#8212;such as street medics and clinics&#8212;is
going to be present in the streets, and have a plan if you
have to go to a hospital (a fake name and social security
number, and an alibi, if you fear you might encounter police
there); be similarly aware of whether legal observers and
media will be present in the streets, and whether you&#8217;ll
want them around or far away from you.</p>
<p> Be
prepared for the situation at hand. If the police outnumber
you, are waiting for you, and there are reporters and civilians
in the area, don&#8217;t come in a gas mask and body armor
like the folks in your favorite street riot photographs&#8212;they&#8217;re
not going to gas and beat you, they&#8217;re going to try
to encircle and arrest you, and you&#8217;ll need to be
able to move quickly and blend well to avoid it.</p>
<p> Clothing
is the one essential feature of the Bloc tactic, and the
rock upon which it rests or founders. Far away from the
action itself, you may want to practice moving and acting
freely in your Bloc gear, so you won&#8217;t still be getting
used to it when it&#8217;s too late. The whole idea of a
Bloc is to look indistinguishable from each other, so make
sure whatever your Bloc theme is, everyone is on the same
page about it, and that your own clothing doesn&#8217;t
bear any features that distinguish it. In a worst-case scenario,
you can make a t-shirt into a mask: use the neck hole for
your eyes, tie the sleeves behind your head.</p>
<p> Your
clothing should protect you from the hazards you expect,
while not weighing you down unnecessarily; it should be
adaptable should unexpected situations arise. Layers are
key: if possible, wear an outer layer in which to travel
to the Bloc action, a layer of Bloc clothing, and then another
layer of getaway clothing beneath this&#8212;without risking
hyperthermia, of course. It may be most sensible to carry
the outer layer of your getaway layer in a sealed bag, in
case you are covered in paint, tear gas, etc. by the time
you need to use it. If you expect chemical weapons attacks,
wear a waterproof outer layer that admits no access, and
under that synthetic fibers that won&#8217;t absorb chemicals
(cotton will). For serious confrontations, choose a gasmask
with shatter-proof lenses and replaceable non-asbestos filters
that won&#8217;t obscure your vision too much; otherwise,
you can breathe through a bandanna soaked in vinegar or
lime juice (transport the bandanna to the action in a sealed
bag; you can carry a lime or two with you to keep it fresh)
and wear swimming goggles (these can be obtained in prescription
form for those who wear eyeglasses; when not wearing them
over your eyes, keep them inside out on your forehead so
they won&#8217;t fog up). You can add a particle mask underneath
the bandanna for extra protection. I&#8217;ve read that
ear plugs can offer some protection against concussion grenades,
but how one is supposed to know when to put them in and
when to have them out so as to be appropriately attentive
is beyond me. If you expect to risk receiving blows or projectile
fire, wear body armor of some kind (sports gear can suffice)
and foam or padding, and a bicycle or motorcycle helmet.</p>
<p> A
Bloc that intends to defend territory in clashes with the
police may decide to use shields. These can be made from
trash can lids or cut traffic barrels, inflatable rafts
or inner tubes heavily reinforced with duct tape and possibly
a layer of tarp, good old-fashioned cardboard, or layered
(super-glued together) and reinforced plexiglass. Soften
up the handles with a thick wrapping of duct tape so the
shock of impact won&#8217;t break your wrists, and provide
plenty of room on the grip so your knuckles don&#8217;t
take all the blow. Larger shields are better for protecting
against projectile weapons or functioning as a mobile barricade,
while smaller ones provide better mobility and serve better
in hand-to-hand combat. A line of individual shield-bearers
can form a shield wall, especially if they are practiced
at moving together; alternatively, massive multi-person
shields can be constructed, such as the insulation board
placards mentioned below. The latter shields should have
enough joints in them to navigate narrower streets; keep
in mind that these joints are also their weakest points.</p>
<p> Slapstick
as it is, it often happens that comrades who discussed and
prepared together will not be able to recognize each other
in their Bloc gear on the day of the action. You may want
to identify yourselves to each other early on, especially
people from different cities and affinity groups who intend
to work together, so it will be easier to keep up with each
other in the chaos.</p>
<p> The
moment the Bloc forms can be pivotal. Where and when to
mask up is a hard question: if you do it too late, once
you&#8217;ve joined the Bloc, you risk being identified;
if you do it too early, before you&#8217;ve joined the Bloc,
you risk being nabbed by the police. Little masked groups
walking around before or after events are perfect targets
for their enemies. At a big demonstration, one of the best
options is to get in your gear in the midst of a large crowd
that is not yet under much surveillance, with people around
you that you trust, and to move in the body of the crowd
to a meeting point with your fellows in the Bloc. Wearing
layers is important here, too: if you can start in a disposable
outermost layer that makes you look like a civilian or liberal
activist (if perhaps one overdressed for the weather), masking
up will simply mean discarding it and simultaneously pulling
up your mask. At an action in which you have the benefit
of surprise, you can always pick a safe, quiet place near
your convergence point and mask up there.</p>
<p> In
a mass action situation, the convergence of the Bloc should
never occur before other protesters are out in the streets;
once again, the police will simply pick off the Bloc when
no one else is there to provide crowd cover or bear witness.
Don&#8217;t mill around for long at your convergence point&#8212;be
timely, and get moving. It can happen that the Bloc has
a difficult time getting out into the field of action, once
it has gathered. One of the best options at a mass action
is to have the Bloc form somewhere outside the area of heavy
police presence, and move into it (uh, if that&#8217;s really
where you need to go! maybe you should consider what you
could accomplish in the other direction&#8230;) as part
of a much larger group, before separating to act as a Bloc.
When moving with a mass of others, a Bloc should keep close
to them as well as tight internally; police may try to push
in and isolate the Bloc.</p>
<p> Once
together, stay tight spatially (with the obvious exception
of the scouts, who need to be further out)&#8212;you need
to keep police out of your ranks, prevent snatch squads
from getting in to grab individuals, and also keep your
friends at your sides rather than strangers or possible
undercover officers. Banners (reinforced with PVC pipe or,
far better, if you can get them safely out into the streets,
great placards made from tough but limber insulation board,
with hand-holds cut into them; these can be tied or chained
together, to create a mobile, jointed full size barricade)
down the front and sides of a group can offer useful barriers
to this end. Remember, your physical presence and togetherness
comprise your strength, your readiness to repel police charges
and foil arrest attempts is your marching permit. If you
strike when they&#8217;re not prepared to make mass arrests
or attack with chemical weapons, they&#8217;ll be forced
to try to intimidate you by singling out individuals for
attack or arrest; make this impossible, defend each other
and don&#8217;t back down.</p>
<p> It&#8217;s
possible to conceal useful materials in an area in advance&#8212;a
dumpster can be filled with sticks and rocks or spraypaint
cans. Sensitive materials (such as projectiles) can be transported
to the action concealed in puppets, and puppets built from
paper mache over stronger stuff can serve as effective shields&#8212;though
those poor puppeteers get enough shit from the secret service
already without suffering on your account too. Keep in mind
that carrying a bag of rocks, bottles, gasoline, etc. will
not look good if you get arrested. Don&#8217;t forget, also,
that with a simple tool it&#8217;s always possible to break
concrete or asphalt up into projectiles on the spot&#8212;beneath
the concrete, the paving stones, isn&#8217;t that how the
old French saying goes?</p>
<p> Everyone
in your group should have a one-time-only nickname for the
duration of the planning and action, so you can address
each other without giving away your identities. Those communicating
over cell phones or hand-held radios can count on the possibility
that the police are listening in; it may be wise for those
doing communications to learn a code of some kind, or at
least keep in mind what not to say over the air. It can
also be good for an affinity group or Bloc to learn coded
announcements in advance, so you can communicate openly
without anyone else understanding. &#8220;Tighten up!&#8221;,
&#8220;The pigs are moving in!&#8221;, &#8220;We need to
break through their lines!&#8221;, &#8220;It&#8217;s time,
let&#8217;s do it!&#8221;, &#8220;Split up and regroup at
convergence point B!&#8221; are all examples of typical
announcements you might want to code. Don&#8217;t use codes
unnecessarily, or assume that if you just say &#8220;cookie&#8221;
every time you mean &#8220;molotov cocktail&#8221; it&#8217;s
going to protect you; clumsy use of code can actually put
you in greater danger, for the authorities can claim that
your coded terms stood for more serious things than they
actually did. Also, don&#8217;t be afraid to make uncoded
announcements to everyone: &#8220;Don&#8217;t panic, stick
together!&#8221;, &#8220;We need to get closer and fill
in this space here, slow down up ahead!&#8221;, &#8220;Medic!&#8221;,
&#8220;Who can verify what he&#8217;s saying?&#8221;, &#8220;Hold
the fucking line!&#8221;</p>
<p> In
the heat of action, it&#8217;s easy for all the structures
you have set up in your affinity group to dissolve as individuals
get caught up in new developments. Don&#8217;t lose your
head and let the mob mentality take over; make sure to stay
spatially close with your group at all times, keep in communication
with them about what is happening, don&#8217;t get distracted
from your role. It might help to have an informal formation&#8212;you
can stay a couple paces behind a particular companion at
all times, with another friend always at your side, and
another behind you, for example. Plans will change, but
don&#8217;t lose the structures that enable you to change
them in unison.</p>
<p> Don&#8217;t
panic, don&#8217;t believe unsubstantiated rumors. You probably
won&#8217;t get a clear idea of what was going on everywhere
else during the action until the day after, if you ever
do; in the midst of everything, it will be easy to get buffeted
about by waves of faulty information, so resist acting on
news until you&#8217;ve double-checked it. Don&#8217;t spread
rumors yourself, and don&#8217;t just tell others your conclusions
based on what you&#8217;ve seen or heard&#8212;tell them
what you&#8217;ve seen or heard and let them draw conclusions
too.</p>
<p> Scouts
should practice using communication equipment without being
obvious, and while bicycling, if applicable; those recognized
as scouts can count on police harassment, which will be
all the more problematic because they are alone and critical
to the success of the group. They should be particularly
quick and alert. Those using radios should make sure they
have decided together on a channel to use in advance, and
a backup channel should there be problems.</p>
<p> Barricades
can be made out of anything from newspaper dispensers to
burning dumpsters, and can serve to slow police progress
or simply halt traffic; if you&#8217;ve scouted in advance,
you should be able to get them in place very quickly, amid
crowd confusion. Don&#8217;t ever completely block off an
escape route you may need! In a less confrontational situation,
you can make it more difficult for the police to follow
you in an organized line by simply moving the wrong way
up a one-way street, provided there&#8217;s still traffic
coming down it. Offensive use of projectiles is serious
stuff&#8212;one can go to prison for many years, if arrested&#8212;but
it can serve to keep police at a distance in order to protect
an area, or provoke them into using tear gas (which may
actually be a tactic they hoped to avoid). Don&#8217;t begin
throwing projectiles in a small group that can be surrounded&#8212;save
it for massive clashes in which the city belongs to the
police in one direction and the protesters in the other.
When you throw, do so as part of a large group, from the
front of the crowd, and maintain a steady hail in the contested
area. Those behind the throwers can take provide more ammunition
via bucket brigade.</p>
<p> If
you&#8217;re planning to do property destruction, come equipped
with the appropriate tools. Make sure you&#8217;re informed
about your targets and their weakness or strength; if you
get in position and strike that felonious blow only to find
you&#8217;re unable to break the shatter-proof glass, you&#8217;ve
just risked a lot for nothing. Sometimes spray paint can
be more eloquent than broken glass: &#8220;Network TV, keep
your eyes on the issues&#8221; across the front of the smashed
corporate storefront they&#8217;ll want to film&#8212;or,
of course, if possible, you can always just spraypaint their
camera lenses! Stay abreast of the different stations&#8217;
coverage, so you can offer a pithy retort to the reporter
who accuses you of interfering with free speech: &#8220;We
saw your coverage of the social forum last night&#8212;you
know as well as I do you don&#8217;t care about free speech.&#8221;
Then disappear into the crowd while he angrily telephones
his boss.</p>
<p> The
most dangerous weapons you should probably ever consider
using in a street confrontation are molotov cocktails. Understand
that if you use these, you can expect serious reprisals
from the police; only do so when you&#8217;ve got a police-free
zone behind you and a sympathetic crowd close by that you
can escape into without unnecessarily endangering anyone.
Best case scenario, you split from the angry mass in a small
team, apply your cocktail, and disappear. Try to aim them
at property, not officers, if possible. Of course, with
the government spending thousands of dollars on each officer&#8217;s
special storm trooper suit, throwing stuff at cops is practically
a victimless crime (and don&#8217;t give me that shit about
more police officers than demonstrators going to the hospital
at the anti-I.M.F. protests in Prague&#8212;first of all,
how many demonstrators do you think felt safe going to those
hospitals, and second of all, haven&#8217;t you ever heard
of offensive injuries?)&#8212;but you&#8217;d be much better
off throwing paint bombs at them (which can be made from
glass bottles, light bulbs, hollow Christmas tree ornaments,
or wax balls filled with paint), or shooting paint gun pellets
from your slingshot. If they get paint over their clear
helmets and shields, no one&#8217;s injured, but they&#8217;re
rendered blind in their expensive armor and have to retreat.</p>
<p> There
is a variety of police weapons that may be deployed against
you: pepper spray, tear gas, water cannons, concussion grenades,
rubber bullets, clubs, charging horses or vehicles. Know
what to expect in each situation, and be prepared. Sometimes
the best defense really is a good offense; a Bloc prepared
to act more quickly and courageously than law enforcers
expect can disable a water cannon before it is employed
against them. Tear gas canisters can be thrown back at the
police, but they will be extremely hot when they land; if
you expect to be doing this, make sure you have on welding
gloves or other serious protection from heat, and that you
have a good enough throwing arm and aim to get them out
of the area entirely. Don&#8217;t pick them up until they
begin releasing gas&#8212;they may explode and injure you.
Horses may balk at approaching an area where things are
on fire; a less confrontational mass can deter a horse charge
by all sitting or lying down.</p>
<p> Police
will endeavor to disperse unwanted crowds when they are
not prepared to arrest them. Tear gas, concussion grenades,
horse charges, rubber bullets, etc. may be employed first,
if the mass seems particularly rowdy; then, when they deem
it safe, the officers will move in. They will probably do
so in lines, charging and falling back to regroup and consolidate
their gain before charging again. Violent individual arrests
will take place at this time to intimidate the mass, unless
the side of the throng facing them is tight-knit and protected
by barricades or united by linked arms. While the crowd
seems volatile and daring, the police may well keep a distance;
if the crowd is confused, passive, or disintegrating, they
may move in to form lines in its midst, to speed the process
along. At no point should you panic and run&#8212;this can
only increase your chances of charging into trouble, and
endanger others in the process; if others start running,
shout out &#8220;Walk, don&#8217;t run!&#8221; At the same
time, keep moving quickly, keep things chaotic to prevent
the police from getting a sense of where their opponents
are or what to expect; never let them come together inside
the mass.</p>
<p> If
you are on the street, they will attempt to force you onto
the sidewalk; this thins the crowd, lowers morale, and puts
you a step closer to being cornered. If you are forced onto
the sidewalk, you can use a street crossing or turn onto
a side street to retake the asphalt; banner-carriers can
rush forward and block the space to be taken while it is
filled with people, as can bicyclists. The same goes for
other lanes of traffic, if they are endeavoring to limit
you to the one you have seized. If the police cannot get
everyone onto the sidewalk, they will at least try to scare
the less militant in the crowd into moving onto it and adopting
a spectator role, so they can then deal with the hard core
contingent; in this case, try to keep moving and circulating
so the &#8220;spectators&#8221; can be absorbed again, though
of course if you are moving in a tight Bloc you don&#8217;t
want to lose your cohesion in such a situation. In an urban
environment, it can be possible for an organized, alert
group to move more quickly on foot than even mounted police
officers; always keep moving and stay ahead of your foes.
Sudden bursts of speed and changes in direction can keep
them particularly confused&#8212;just make sure your group
can engage in these without itself becoming confused or
divided. To coordinate simultaneous action in large groups,
you can shout out a countdown from ten to one.</p>
<p> Police
snatch squads can be sent into a crowd to grab individuals
the police consider leaders or dangerous (or who have been
observed committing a crime). Sometimes you can clearly
see the commanding officer point out an individual to be
snatched (this can also be the case if there is an officer
firing rubber bullets&#8212;another officer may be picking
out the targets for him, and by watching you can tell who
is about to be targeted). The squad will attempt to surround
the target, while keeping an open corridor back to police
lines. To protect against this, keep a close watch on police
movements&#8212;they may form a straight line perpendicular
to the mass before pushing in. If you know who the target
is, get them out of the area and into different clothing.
Put your body between approaching officers and the target;
keep moving and obstructing their path, while making it
seem as accidental as possible, so as not to become a target
yourself. If a group can isolate and surround individual
officers that have entered a crowd, these will back off
if they don&#8217;t feel in control.</p>
<p> Others
can attempt to unarrest individuals who have been nabbed.
The time to do this is as soon as the police strike, before
they have made their way back to their lines. You&#8217;ll
need a few people to break the officers&#8217; grip and
others to block their path. As soon as your comrade is free,
link arms and disappear immediately into the crowd. The
squad will probably try to snatch again, and will aim for
the unarresters now too; keep in mind that unarresting may
result in more serious criminal charges than the original
target would have faced, so only hazard it if you have a
good chance of success or the stakes are too high not to.
It has happened before that police vehicles surrounded by
an angry crowd have been forced to release arrestees, but
they have to be trapped there, not just heckled. If their
tires are punctured (stick the sidewall, not the tread),
that will force them to a halt, but popping tires can be
loud&#8212;again, don&#8217;t try this unless you&#8217;re
in a trusted crowd with cover in range.</p>
<p> If
you are grabbed by police, keep in mind that even self-defense
of the mildest sort can result in assault charges. If you
expect your companions to try to snatch you back, keep the
arresting officers&#8217; job difficult by continuing to
move, or else go limp: this will not result in assault charges
(though &#8220;resisting arrest&#8221; is not unheard of),
and will force the officers to work much harder to move
you. Bear in mind that going limp may provoke them into
being even more violent to you. If every arrest they make
costs them a lot of manpower and time, your friends will
be in a better position to escape or attempt to rescue you.</p>
<p> There&#8217;s
always the chance that the police will totally surround
your group and arrest you one by one. If this occurs, you&#8217;re
in trouble. The best defense is to keep abreast of police
movement by means of scouts: they may attempt to move up
side streets to surround you, or lure you forward while
sending a line around to cut off your retreat. If you find
your group surrounded by police lines that are thin in one
direction, you can attempt to charge out: use your own tight
front line, protected with a barrier (banner, shields, fencing,
linked arms at the least), to push as a solid wall, potentially
with a plow point at the very front to divide them. A Bloc
once used a wheelbarrow appropriated from a construction
site to front a charge that broke through police lines.
Apply this tactic as soon as possible after you&#8217;ve
been encircled, before they are entirely sure of the situation,
and with maximum confidence if you want it to work. Often
your best chance to escape will be all together as a cohesive
group; this also allows you to keep your equipment and clothing
in the process, so you can maintain your effectiveness as
a Bloc, even if you only choose to use it to escape. On
the other hand, if you are part of a crowd that is moving
into what you think is a trap, it may be wisest just to
disappear onto the sidewalk and out of your Bloc gear before
you enter a space you can&#8217;t escape. If you are hopelessly
trapped, make sure you ditch all incriminating items before
you are arrested, hopefully in such a way that they cannot
be connected to you.</p>
<p> Remember
that the police won&#8217;t be able to make mass arrests
unless they have lots of plastic handcuffs and vans or busses
in the area, so these can be a good tip-off for what to
expect. The same goes for chemical weapons; if they&#8217;re
ready to use tear gas, they&#8217;ll all be wearing gasmasks
themselves.</p>
<p> Think
about what the goals of the police will be, and how these
affect your options: if they are trying to keep a parade
route or fenced area secure, you may actually have free
run of other areas for some time. If they are trying to
keep a massive march under observation, they will have to
split their forces to keep up with a breakaway march; this
will only be difficult for them if they are unprepared in
numbers, of course, but in certain situations it may be
true that ten groups of fifty are much more effective than
one group of five hundred. There will be moments during
unexpected developments when they are paralyzed waiting
for orders; take advantage of these&#8212;but if an unusually
long period passes without police activity, it may be an
indication that they have a trick up their sleeves, such
as a new, more heavily armed and armored force massing nearby.</p>
<p> At
an action the powers that be see coming, you can expect
to be under surveillance by undercover officers, and you
may have to deal with agents provocateurs, too. Stay aware
of those around you, especially strangers; undercover agents
may be easy to identify (pairs of big men with two days
of stubble on their faces, nice wristwatches, and communications
equipment), or very difficult to. Keep your companions aware
of every person you suspect, but don&#8217;t &#8220;out&#8221;
undercover agents unless you are absolutely sure they are
agents (for example, one of your scouts has been following
one, and seen him chatting with his coworkers), and something
concrete can be gained from it. Unsubstantiated accusations
between demonstrators can only make situations more tense
and demonstration environments less welcoming. As for agents
provocateurs and just plain stupid people, they may be moving
among or near you, smashing locally owned stores and private
vehicles; whether or not you can prove they are cops or
allies thereof, you can certainly make it clear to them
that what they are doing is unacceptable and has to stop.
Don&#8217;t get snarled up in a tactical debate in the middle
of an action, just make your point (or, in a worst case
scenario, intervene) and get on with things.</p>
<p> Stay
aware of others, too, besides the police; other demonstrators
of more &#8220;liberal&#8221; or authoritarian bents may
take it upon themselves to interfere your activities, unmasking
you, assaulting you, or pointing you out to authorities;
the same goes for local civilians. Never, ever respond to
this with violence; walk away, or run if necessary. A direct
action that turns into a brawl with locals or other activists
is disastrous for everyone. Attempt to talk out differences,
if this appears possible and worthwhile, when tempers have
cooled, in a safe space removed from the immediate action;
send a spokesperson if necessary, preferably a supporter
from outside the Bloc. At the least, this can distract the
meddlers while the rest of the group moves on to other actions.</p>
<p> As
crazy as things get, remember that the police have firearms,
and there&#8217;s rarely any reason to risk getting killed
for an action. A street confrontation with better-armed
police officers is almost always going to be something more
of a spectacle of confrontation than a no-holds-barred,
life-or-death battle; there&#8217;s no shame in this fact,
it&#8217;s just important to take into account. The police
are restricted in what they can do by what public opinion
will decree about it; you are limited in what you can do
by a similar question, for whenever you move up to a more
confrontational tactic the police will immediately upgrade
their tactics to a level higher than yours. In this sense,
streetfighting is a matter of chivalry for us radicals:
we always permit our opponents the more powerful tools,
in order to keep the violence from getting too out of hand&#8212;and,
of course, to show off how much more noble and courageous
we are! If the papers read (as they have before) &#8220;Violence
erupted when activists began throwing back tear gas canisters
fired by the police,&#8221; it will be clear to everyone
what&#8217;s going on.</p>
<p> Stay
flexible, tactically. If you showed up in riot gear for
a confrontation with the police, but find yourselves totally
outnumbered and unprepared, you can turn the other direction
and move through nearby neighborhoods picking up trash and
beautifying the area&#8212;that&#8217;ll give the media
a confusing message to distort!</p>
<p> Once
again, all this will be very different if you are applying
the Bloc tactic outside the demonstration setting. Rather
than engaging in a confrontation with the police which you
hope will be contagious, or at least risking the possibility,
you will probably be doing everything you can to avoid encountering
the police. Scouts, in this case, will serve more to warn
you about the approach of the police than to monitor the
lumbering movements of nearby police forces, and, accordingly,
may be better posted at freeway overpasses or in disguise
outside the liquor store than on bicycles.</p>
<p> Escape:
at the end of the action, the final remaining challenge
is to get out of your gear and disappear. Layers, once again,
are key: under your Bloc clothing, you should be wearing
clothing that will make you blend easily with whatever liberal
protesters or civilians will be in the area. You may have
to get down to this layer at an instant&#8217;s notice:
for instance, if the police have singled you out and are
pursuing you. Make sure it&#8217;s a quick and easy transition
to make (though not one that can happen accidentally, in
the midst of the action!). Try to do this in a mass of inattentive
people, or around a corner or in a bush; if you&#8217;re
seen or caught on camera changing, all that trouble you
went to masking up may be wasted. Hopefully you have a clever
escape route or two already planned out: an inconspicuous
alley, an open space too wide for any police barricade to
block, a fence you can climb more quickly than any pig officer.
If possible, you might want to lock a bicycle somewhere
nearby, so once you&#8217;ve gotten away you can hop on
that and move quickly; in urban environments, you can also
try to get a taxi (provided they&#8217;re out and about),
or get on the subway (though in a serious situation this
may be shut down, or the police checking people coming in),
or duck into a restaurant and just eat fries in a quiet
corner in your civilian disguise until things quiet down.
Unless things have gotten really hairy, you should still
be with your partner, if not a few members of your affinity
group.</p>
<p>Finally,
the number one rule of all direct action: quit while you&#8217;re
ahead. Take things as far as you can, but live to fight
another day, unless this really is the Last Battle.</p>
<h3>Afterwards</h3>
<p> After
the action, gather again in your affinity group at a place
and time safely removed from danger and surveillance. Give
everyone a space to share how they&#8217;re feeling. Discuss
and critique what happened, what you learned from it, what
it means for the future. If applicable, make sure to report
on your conclusions to other affinity groups who were involved,
and seek their feedback as well. If any of you have been
arrested or are facing other difficulties such as injury,
discuss how to handle this. Celebrate your achievements,
offer emotional support, swear and plot revenge if need
be. Make sure above all that everyone involved knows they
are loved and supported.</p>
<p> Don&#8217;t
ever brag about your achievements in a Bloc, or share anything
others don&#8217;t need to know, especially if it could
incriminate someone. Keep in mind that it&#8217;s possible
you&#8217;ve been caught on camera and, however carefully
disguised you were, identified by the authorities. In Sweden,
a few months after a street confrontation at a meeting of
the European Union, early one morning the police arrived
at the residences of a couple dozen activists who had been
involved and arrested them all at the same moment. That&#8217;s
a worst case scenario&#8212;don&#8217;t let it make you
paranoid. Just stay aware of the dangers; if you&#8217;re
doing a lot of heavy stuff, or organizing for it, you might
want to live in such a way that your enemies would be hard-pressed
to know where to find you any given morning.</p>

<p> Local
anarchists and Earth First!ers wanted to make an offensive
strike against a biotechnology company whose crimes had
not been brought to public attention (in fact, the corporation
had bribed the local town government). There was considerable
discussion about what tactics to use&#8212;and there was
a huge variety of tactical differences, with some of us
committed to non-violence and others being wild militant
anarcho-primitivists! Being from small towns in an area
not well-known for having lots of activists, we had to work
together to allow everyone to participate at whatever level
they were comfortable. The non-violent folks could have
dropped a banner, or someone might have come at night and
shredded the crops, but what could be done that would allow
us to work together, be safe, damage this evil corporation,
and provide a wake up call such as our placid small towns
had never seen before? What better than the &#8216;bloc&#8217;!
Who says we need a major mobilization or a giant anti-war
protest to use such tactics? We can have the excitement
and the action of any global day of action any day of the
week in our own town. It&#8217;s not like there&#8217;s
more state to smash in Washington D.C., Genoa, or Seattle
than there is in our own neighborhoods. Not only that, but
this time the cops wouldn&#8217;t be ready for us.</p>
<p> Since
we were going to combat biotechnology, it made more sense
for us to dress in biohazard suits than in black&#8212;not
only did they disguise us, but they got our message across
by themselves. Bought in bulk, they were less than three
dollars each. The suits lacked face masks, so we made a
quick trip down to the hospital for them. We started spreading
news of the action to our friends by word of mouth, keeping
our bloc limited to only those we trusted.</p>
<p> Committed
folks drove in from out of town and set up a &#8216;base
camp&#8217; for the action at a local farm, building banners,
preparing flags, writing flyers and media releases. The
excitement was contagious: local puppeteers brought down
a gargantuan puppet of an indigenous farmer, and a local
farmer wanted to dig up the front lawn of the biotechnology
company to plant organic seeds. Work was spontaneously and
naturally divided among teams: media, art, etc. The media
team made different pamphlets for different people&#8212;one
for the corporate media, one for people walking down the
street, even one for the employees working there to explain
to them what was happening. As time progressed and more
and more car-loads of people drove down the dirt road to
the farm, we knew that Monday morning, our day to strike,
was going to be larger than we expected.</p>
<p> We
had picked our target in complete secrecy, and only a few
people knew its name and location. If somehow word had leaked
to the biotechnology company that we were planning something,
our action would have been ruined. Unlike many blocs at
protests, we didn&#8217;t have a horde of protesters to
serve as a distraction, so the main element in our favor
was surprise. We told everyone else to trust us&#8212;it
was going to be a biotechnology target somewhere nearby&#8212;and
that we had scoped it out. Indeed, we had discovered that
the entire complex, one of the main research centers for
a biotechnology company, had only a few security guards!</p>
<p> This
company had genetically engineered corn to feature &#8220;traitor
seeds,&#8221; seeds modified to be dependent on their expensive
pesticides. Farmers would purchase these cheap seeds, and
then go into debt buying the pesticide, losing their land
and livelihood. This destruction of small and indigenous
farming and of biodiversity was leading to huge demonstrations
in Brazil and India in which these crops were ripped from
the ground and the seeds burnt, in public! These seeds were
being designed right down the street&#8212;and no one even
knew about it. The company was so smug they didn&#8217;t
even hire much in the way of security. Everyone agreed that
it was a worthy target, and everyone from pacifists to militants
was happy with keeping the exact location secret until the
day of action.</p>
<p> The
night before, we went over a map, including aerial photos
(which are easily downloaded from the internet&#8212;try
www.terraserver.) and detailed maps. We didn&#8217;t give
away the precise location except to one driver from each
of the cars. People were given an all-too-quick training
on un-arresting and bloc techniques, and communication equipment
was distributed among the affinity groups. This lack of
training, especially considering most of the participants
had never been part of a bloc, was a great mistake. Still,
affinity groups had come together naturally over the few
days before the action, everyone joining groups with close
friends who wanted to risk the same level of arrest and
participate in the same type of action. Without any argument
or coercion, autonomous groups had formed for a truly diverse
range of actions: climbing on the roof of the building and
dropping banners, digging up the front yard of the biotechnology
company to plant seeds, doing independent media work, passing
out flyers on the sides of nearby highways to the traffic
that would be snarled by the spectacle we were to create,
performing in a play involving the giant indigenous farmer
puppet, acting as police liaisons (a police liaison is a
person whose job is basically to delay the police by acting
as the &#8216;spokesperson&#8217; for the group), and, of
course, property destruction. Surprisingly, there was no
predictable conflict about violence versus non-violence;
everyone felt that they were participating in a collective
action in which every group and every action was vital to
the overall success of the whole project&#8212;the project
at hand being to utterly humiliate a biotechnology company
that had counted on no one even knowing they existed.</p>
<p> At
the crack of dawn, everyone put on their biotechnology suits,
double-checked their props, and jumped into their cars.
We parked in the parking lots of a nearby hotel and family
restaurant, and ran into the front yard of the massive biotechnology
complex. Immediately groups scrambled up onto the roof and
dropped banners; other groups began spray-painting &#8216;Fuck
Biotechnology&#8217; and &#8216;Free the Seed&#8217; on
the walls of the building. Giant banners were unfurled,
and within minutes an unearthly play began, with groups
of biotechnology-suited people and a traditionally-dressed
farmer tearing up the carefully manicured lawn of the company,
planting organic seeds, while giant biotechnology corn visuals
were erected facing the highway. The employees of the company
must have thought one of their own experiments had gone
horribly awry, and fled inside, locking their doors and
staring out the windows. The security guards, vastly outnumbered,
just watched with mouths agape. This entire action was visible
from the highway, and more participants dressed in biohazard
suits handed our flyers out and carefully talked through
the issues with passing traffic&#8212;traffic that soon
ground to a halt. Within fifteen minutes, our action had
completely paralyzed one of the largest biotechnology companies
in the world and had frozen traffic on one of the major
highways in the United States. Of course, it was the cops
that actually shut down the highway&#8212;maybe in fear
the public would see the spectacle ahead.</p>
<p> Of
course the cops did come eventually&#8212;although, due
to the element of surprise, we had free run of the place
for almost an hour. Even when the first cops arrived, they
realized like the security guards that they were outnumbered
by a large mass of maniacs in biotech suits. They tried
&#8220;talking&#8221; to our police liaisons, who repeatedly
told them we had to consult with each other on any decision,
a delaying tactic that enabled us to get more of the action
done&#8212;a mistake in retrospect, since that was when
we should have re-grouped and prepared for the inevitable
police assault. Even after reinforcements arrived, the cops
were afraid to act until some of the businessmen came out
of the office and whispered in their ears. A few of the
officers began trying to arrest people, starting by arresting
the only person they could identify&#8212;the farmer. Unfortunately,
all the affinity groups were so absorbed in carrying out
the actions they had planned they let some precious seconds
pass before they could act&#8212;and by then the police
managed to pepper-spray one individual in the face. However,
through quick thinking, our white biotech suit disguises,
and some ridiculously brave unarresting techniques (including
giving cops wedgies and pulling people free from their grasp)
we managed to protect almost everyone from arrest.</p>
<p> At
this point the bloc had become a very loose cluster of affinity
groups, most folks not even spatially near each other, which
played into the hands of the cops. When calls to &#8216;bloc
up&#8217; were made, it soon became apparent most people
didn&#8217;t have any idea what we were talking about, and
had little grasp that by gathering together as a larger
group we could stand off the cops&#8212;a difficulty due
to our lack of training beforehand. Still, when cops came
out on bikes, protesters nimbly jumped over fences to avoid
them, leading one cop to a near-collision with the fence!
For a good fifteen minutes pure pandemonium reigned, with
cops unsuccessfully chasing protesters and protesters swarming
outside the cops&#8217; grasp without evacuating the premises
of the company. The farmer chose to be arrested non-violently
while the person who was pepper-sprayed was finally cuffed
after a considerable battle. Finally, the cops settled down
and agreed to let us move our protest off the premises.
Rescuing our giant banners, we managed to regroup our scattered
forces and make a quick getaway to our cars. Altogether,
out of fifty-some people at the action, there were three
arrests. </p>
<p> We
tried to make it back to our secret hide-out, only to find
out the city had sent undercover cops after us. After some
quick driving, we escaped the police and pulled into a truck
station&#8212;we had to dispose of our biotech suits, which
we were still wearing! We went around back to an isolated
dumpster and began throwing our biotech suits and other
incriminating evidence inside. Then, to our surprise, we
noticed a trucker watching us through his shades. He gave
us a thumbs up and a shady smile. Our victory was all over
the CB radios!</p>
<p> Reunited
at our secret hideout, we gathered around and decided to
march downtown and to the jail. Everywhere, people were
talking about our action, at diners and in shopping centers,
old men and young women&#8212;no one had seen it coming,
and people got the message! Not only that, but almost everyone
was supportive&#8212;&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe they&#8217;re
putting that in our food,&#8221; &#8220;they&#8217;re messing
with God&#8217;s creation,&#8221; &#8220;that company&#8217;s
just out to make money regardless of the cost to this town
or the world&#8221; &#8230;I had never before seen such
a positive reaction to an action. When we finally got to
the jail, our boring little town was scandalized&#8212;as
was the biotech company!</p>
<p> A
lawyer agreed to defend the defendants for two hundred bucks,
and we raised the money through benefit concerts in which
every style of music from punk to bluegrass was played.
In court, the cops admitted that due to everyone wearing
white biotech suits they were unable to identify exactly
who did what, so they couldn&#8217;t really make any charges
stick. At the end, the defendants were let off with community
service and the cops even apologized!</p>
<p> As
in any action, there were things that went wrong and things
that went right. We definitely had free run of the place
for a while, and could have inflicted much more serious
damage on the biotechnology company than we did&#8212;at
the risk of possibly alienating some people. Given the weight
of the issue, it probably would have been worth it. We definitely
should have done more unarresting trainings&#8212;the methods
we used, like jumping and wrestling with cops, may be courageous,
but are not recommended. We could have also used a good
bloc training&#8212;people didn&#8217;t really respond when
folks called out &#8216;bloc up&#8217; to tighten our ranks.
Fifty people together could definitely have stood up the
cops, but when people panicked and began running around
as lone individuals, the cops managed to nab them. Lastly,
we should have had a lawyer ready ahead of time. Still,
hindsight is always clearer than foresight, and the creative
use of bloc tactics with great public outreach made this
an action people in our small town will be talking about
for years&#8212;and one that&#8217;s caused the biotechnology
company considerable grief and expense. </p>
<p> There
are some that say the bloc is dead, but it is only as dead
as the ideas that motivate it. Trying to repeat Seattle
is going to fail: those ideas died after they were employed,
but they were well and alive at the time because they were
new and creative: the cops couldn&#8217;t see them coming.
Don&#8217;t just think about previous blocs, look around
you for living inspiration. The real question is not whether
the bloc is dead or alive, but what ideas we can come up
with for striking the next blow against capitalism. May
that next blow be a killing one! </p>
