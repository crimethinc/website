<h1>Bringing the Heat in Miami</h1>
<h5>An Analysis of Direct Action<br />
at the Nov.
2003 F.T.A.A. Ministerial</h5>
<h3>VICTORY BEFORE WE EVEN HIT THE STREETS</h3><p>
It was almost a miracle, not to mention a victory for our
movement, that the mobilization in Miami happened at all.
Miami was one of the most repressive police states North
America has ever witnessed; the $8.5 million security plan,
funded by federal anti-terrorism dollars, fortified an already
incredibly brutal police force. In the days leading up to
the event, paramilitary police stood guard on every downtown
corner, arresting anyone who looked like they might be a
protester. The media engaged in a smear campaign of lies
and slander about anarchists, lionizing the police force
that was to protect the city from these invading beasts.
Plans for the protest seemed to grow murkier rather than
clearer as the event approached. Many expected the worst.</p>
<p>Not
to be deterred, anarchists entered a city with no infrastructure
for direct action and set one up in a mere few weeks. The
convergence and welcome centers, the legal, medical, and
food support, the independent media and art spaces&#8212;these
expressions of mutual aid, solidarity, and gift economics
were living examples of the world we are fighting for. This
infrastructure, pulled together in such a short period of
time, was comparable to analogous structures that have taken
months and even years to set up in cities that regularly
host mobilizations. Our ability to put down such roots in
the face of such repression is a moving example of the strength
of our movement.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>WE
ARE EVERYWHERE</h3><p>
On Thursday afternoon, as a mass of activists were beating
a spirited retreat from the police line to the sound of
marching drums and whistles, a legal observer turned to
face his comrades. &#8220;As your legal observer, I advise
you to&#8230;&#8221; he began, echoing the familiar words
of many a legal observer before him, &#8220;&#8230;pull
shit into the middle of the street and set it on fire!!&#8221;
Cheering ensued all around.</p>
<p>This
anecdote foregrounds a marked difference in our movement
today from the atmosphere of even three years ago, when
direct action tactics such as property destruction were
extremely controversial. Many of the liberals who claimed
we were going to wreck &#8220;their&#8221; movement with
our confrontational approaches are gone&#8212;they&#8217;ve
joined us or disappeared. And the new people who have gotten
involved have, in large part, done so because they are attracted
to the opportunity to confront power, rather than merely
beseech it.</p>
<p> The
mainstream media kept referring to an elusive minority of
&#8220;bad&#8221; or &#8220;violent&#8221; protestors, the
so-called &#8220;self-described anarchists&#8221;&#8212;as
if there was any other kind! But make no mistake about it&#8212;besides
the Root Cause and union marches, Miami was largely an anarchist
mobilization. The entire infrastructure described above,
including the convergence center, planning framework, and
Indymedia coverage, was organized on decentralized anarchist
principles. Nearly everyone involved was indeed a &#8220;self-described
anarchist.&#8221; Even many of the N.G.O. employees in Miami
were closeted anarchists! And not only that: people and
press mobbed a forum in Lake Worth called &#8220;A New World
in Our Hearts,&#8221; to hear about anarchy from anarchists
themselves&#8212;and some of the attendees were inspired
to offer assistance, or even join the protests themselves.</p>
<p> This
is not to say that we anarchists are not still struggling
with internal problems&#8212;with sensitivities to race,
class, and gender, for example, which groups like Anarchist
People of Color brought to the forefront. One manifestation
of this was discrimination against older people or people
perceived, especially by the security crew, to be &#8220;normal,&#8221;
i.e. from outside the anarchist community proper. In one
episode which almost beggars belief, a group of long-time
anarchist organizers who had dressed in civilian clothes
to avoid police attention were set upon by some other activists
who attempted to force them to give them their food! If
we dismiss, alienate, or immediately suspect people who
look and dress differently than the stereotypical black-hooded
anarchist, we will piss off our most valuable allies&#8212;and
many anarchists as well!</p>
<p> On
the other hand, there were some remarkable bridges built
across demographic lines. One of the best examples of this
took place on Tuesday, November 18, when some anarchists
typically associated with the Black Bloc got together for
a ritual with the Pagan Cluster. Words cannot describe the
feelings of solidarity and love experienced by these two
groups, groups many would have written off as incompatible:
singing, dancing, drumming, raging, and continuing an alliance
built in the front-lines of earlier street battles, we wove
a web that knit our communities together to be stronger
and more inclusive. The black and gold bracelets that were
shared that night could be seen on many a wrist over the
following days, an uplifting affirmation of common cause
and courage in the face of adversity.</p>
<h3>SUPPORT
FROM UNEXPECTED PLACES</h3>
<p>Presumably, one of the reasons the powers that be picked
Miami to host the negotiations for the Free Trade Area of
the Americas was the ostensible absence of an anarchist
community. All sorts of rumors went around in advance about
how the locals were all going to be hostile to us, would
perhaps even attack us. The discovery we made upon arriving
in Miami&#8212;that not everyone there is a pro-capitalist
Cuban refugee, that there are people everywhere who are
suffering under the heel of the corporate class and know
it&#8212;should be a reminder not to get carried away by
our own alarmism in the future. In countless experiences
with locals, we received heartfelt support and encouragement.
Most people don&#8217;t believe everything they see on television,
nor do they appreciate their neighborhoods being overrun
by belligerent police officers&#8212;nor do they believe
corporate capitalism offers us the best of all possible
worlds.</p>
<p> The
police and media spent months and millions spreading the
lie that small family-run businesses in downtown Miami would
be destroyed in an orgy of anarchist violence. In an effort
organized from the convergence center the week before the
days of action, many activists visited businesses with letters
of solidarity explaining anarchist ideas, the content of
the proposed F.T.A.A., and what to expect from the upcoming
demonstrations&#8212;not to recruit, but to give people
an idea of why the protests were taking place. Most welcomed
these activists with open arms, glad to hear what they had
suspected all along to be police hype dispelled by the protesters
themselves. One person working at a local business said
she had enough papers and letters from the police on the
upcoming protests to start a fire&#8212;and she just might!
In support, some shops even gave protestors free food or
offered their stores as havens to those wishing to escape
the police. Outreach efforts like these are powerful direct
actions themselves, not to mention examples of successful
acts of resistance in a city suffering such vicious police
occupation that just walking downtown put individuals at
risk of arrest.</p>
<h3>DIRECT
ACTION PLANNING</h3><p>
Despite all the pressure and police intimidation tactics,
or perhaps even partly owing to the ambience they created,
there was an incredible energy among activists in Miami
in the days leading up to the F.T.A.A. ministerial. The
convergence space was buzzing with activity; spokescouncil
meetings were held every night to plan for the actions.
The spokescouncil meetings focused on a direct action framework
for what was to be the main day of action, Thursday, November
20, as well as a jail solidarity plan, preparations for
smaller actions throughout the duration of the convergence,
and general logistics for the convergence space itself.</p>
<p> Arriving
in Miami, everyone wanted to know what the direct action
plan was. As a large percentage of those participating in
the actions came from far away, much of the organizing was
done in a decentralized fashion. Consultas were held regionally
throughout the U.S.; affinity groups and clusters made plans
to implement when they arrived. In the months leading up
to the event, it really seemed like people were coming with
tight, organized plans to contribute to a larger collective
action. Early the preceding summer, the plan for a Padded
Bloc emerged, and organizers in Pittsburgh announced that
a large number of people equipped with armor and shields
would be ready to defend areas from police. This plan didn&#8217;t
actually materialize. Word of this plan helped to build
momentum as people prepared for the protests, but it also
spread the illusion that more people planned to attend than
actually did, and that people were more prepared then they
ended up being.</p>
<p> What
happened in the end was far less organized than many expected.
In conference calls and a consulta in Gainesville, a small
working group was formed to plan a structure for direct
action. This group planned a very basic framework that relied
heavily on the independent planning of those who were to
participate in it; but it seemed that the plan was not clear
enough for many to know how to plug into it, even if they
were prepared to do so in the first place. A 7 a.m. gathering
was planned at Government Center a few blocks from the fence
surrounding the hotel where the summit was taking place.
The idea was that people would rally and then march towards
the fence to carry out actions to &#8220;bring down the
fence and shut down the F.T.A.A. meetings.&#8221;</p>
<p> In
an attempt to placate the A.F.L.-C.I.O., there was an agreement
made at the spokescouncil meetings that the direct action
would stay clear of the intersection of Flagler and Biscayne
between 11 a.m. and 5 p.m., the hours when the union march
was to take place. Some felt that this decision was forced
through without regard for the perspectives of many activists.
Flagler and Biscayne is the main intersection in downtown
Miami; it was the area outside the fence closest to the
F.T.A.A. meeting site, and it ended up being the only place
close to the fence that was accessible. This plan disregarded
the rules of thumb that have helped to make direct action
successful in the past: it meant that direct action activists
would be alone out on the streets, with no permitted areas
or safe zones to retreat to. Essentially, agreeing to a
separate time of day for direct action offered the police
a perfect excuse to brutalize and arrest everyone on the
streets of downtown Miami outside the hours of the permitted
march.</p>
<p> Naturally,
this situation scared off many people who were uncertain
about participating in direct action; it also gave the police
a justification for picking people off before they got to
the action, or at least blocking them out. These considerations
may explain why the turnout for direct action in Miami was
so much lower than expected&#8212;in the end, it was not
so much the intimidation of the police as a lack of concrete
and convincing preparation on our part that discouraged
more people from joining in. </p>
<p> This
submissiveness to the wishes of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. hierarchy
compromised the times and places of the direct action while
gaining little except empty words of &#8220;solidarity&#8221;
from the union officials. After months of frustrating negotiations
with them, representatives of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. hierarchy
were still being introduced as &#8220;allies&#8221; by facilitators
and certain others at spokescouncil meetings. We anarchists
can choose our own allies, thank you very much; we should
not unquestionably accept such loaded terms as descriptions
of organizations that have done little in the past to warrant
being called allies. And, not surprisingly, while affinity
groups of rank and file union members did join the protesters
in the streets, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. hierarchy urged union
members to flee the protests into their buses as soon as
their permitted march ended.</p>
<p> Ultimately,
this &#8220;direct action free&#8221; period during the
main hours of the protest reinforced separation between
members of unions and direct action activists, a separation
that must be destroyed for both our sakes. Yes, it is important
not to provoke unnecessary conflicts, but when representatives
of a hierarchical organization that has a history of selling
out workers&#8217; struggles inform us that the best way
we direct action activists can show solidarity with them
is by not engaging in direct action&#8230; well, even if
a spokescouncil of anarchists decides to honor their request,
that shouldn&#8217;t prevent the rest of us from making
up our own minds about the issue responsibly, and being
prepared to do the organizing to make another approach possible
if we deem it worthwhile.</p>
<h3>IF
YOU ATTACK ONE OF US, YOU ATTACK ALL OF US</h3><p>
Despite all these factors, the protesters made the best
of their situation. At the last minute, a section of the
Black Bloc decided to meet at the Convergence Center, many
blocks away from the fence, where it was felt they could
at least marshal a whole bloc to defend themselves, and
travel into downtown side by side with puppeteers and foreign
media for safety; but the puppeteers with automobiles, and
most of the media, ended up driving to downtown, leaving
them isolated on foot. For a time, this bloc march had the
advantage of surprise, and it took a few minutes for the
police to mobilize to block their route; but after a scuffle
the bloc was contained, and attempted negotiations with
the police only resulted in the bloc being contained again
and brutally attacked with tasers and clubs. Ultimately,
the group was forced to disperse, and some were arrested.</p>
<p> The
larger group of protesters met as planned in Government
Center at a peaceful rally, and then marched to the fence.
Once there, a single grappling hook was successfully thrown
and hooked on the &#8220;anarchist-proof&#8221; fence&#8212;and
it did wobble! But as the Padded Bloc didn&#8217;t end up
coming together, the police were able to attack an essentially
undefended crowd. They attacked mercilessly with concussion
grenades and rubber bullets, and charged peaceful and dancing
protesters with their clubs and batons, brutally beating
many. Heroic defenses were staged, bottles thrown, but little
could be done in the face of such overwhelming attack.</p>
<p> A
couple hours later, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. march took off. Many
protesters tried to join, but were stopped at first by the
A.F.L.-C.I.O. marshals, who only much later let the protesters
in. Even inside the march, some protesters were attacked
by police, and though steelworkers&#8212;not marshals!&#8212;came
to their rescue, a few were arrested. At the conclusion
of the march, new conflicts began with the police, that
proved to be some of the most dramatic and exciting of the
day&#8230; yet even then, the overwhelming force of the
police ultimately forced us to split apart and flee to safety.
Protesters were attacked by police wielding batons, tear
gas and pepper spray and other chemical agents, and rubber,
wooden, and plastic bullets. Over one hundred protestors
were treated for injuries; quite a few were hospitalized&#8212;one
with a bits of a police bullet in his head! Small groups
leaving the protests were also targeted by police. </p>
<p>
As people regrouped themselves, it was clear that the protest
was neither a failure nor a success. It was far from a victory&#8212;many
of us were wounded and bleeding, others in jail. The fence
was not taken down and we had not had the numbers or militancy
that we had hoped for. But it was a show of strength and
courage that we assembled that day in the heart of the world&#8217;s
most well-defended police-state, and survived.<br>
</p>
<h3>WHAT
DID WORK: <br />
Building Alliances, Putting Down Roots, and Taking
Aim</h3>
<p>
Outside the haze of tear gas and robo-cops wielding guns
and batons, there were many successful aspects of the Miami
mobilization against the F.T.A.A., and it&#8217;s important
that these efforts aren&#8217;t obscured by all the discussion
of police brutality. Here are a few:</p>
<p> -Free
housing, free food, free legal and free medical support
was provided by and for thousands of people throughout the
mobilization. Talk about workable alternatives to capitalism!</p>
<p> -The
Green and Eco-Bloc set up a community garden in Overtown,
and distributed cherry trees throughout the neighborhood
as well as sharing gardening skills and other resources
that will be of lasting value.</p>
<p> -Hundreds
of people participated in the Root Cause march, which crossed
the thirty four miles from Fort Lauderdale to Miami, one
mile for every country involved in the F.T.A.A. discussions.
The march connected important struggles in South Florida
to the F.T.A.A. and brought out the ways that poor communities
and people of color in the region are already being affected
by &#8220;free&#8221; trade. Many alliances were built and
strengthened between those who took part in this march.</p>
<p> -Six
weeks before the F.T.A.A. ministerial, the anarchists in
the Lake Worth Global Justice Group organized the Free Carnival
Area of the Americas (F.C.A.A.) in Lake Worth, Florida,
about one hour north of Miami. The F.C.A.A. opened a warehouse
to provide space for puppet and art making, planning meetings
and workshops, and other preparations for protests against
the F.T.A.A. They put out a call for activists to join them
in this effort in the weeks before the F.T.A.A. ministerial.
The art and puppets were used in the Root Cause march and
the direct actions in Miami, and the activist infrastructure
in Lake Worth contributed in other crucial ways to the mobilization.
Many other inspiring and successful events occurred under
the umbrella of the Free Carnival Area of the Americas,
too.</p>
<p> -Both
prior to the main days of action and after, anarchists in
South Florida organized three press conferences and public
forums. One of these events, entitled &#8220;A New World
in Our Hearts,&#8221; was held in Lake Worth a week before
the main days of action. It attracted large numbers of people
from the Lake Worth community and helped to get many involved
in organizing and playing other supportive roles, such as
providing much-needed housing for activists arriving from
out of town. </p>
<p> -A
couple affinity groups working together compiled and distributed
packets including posters, wheatpaste, stickers, annotated
maps, and similar redecorating tools to dozens of other
groups and individuals. Several crews covered various Miami
neighborhoods with messages of resistance to the F.T.A.A.
in the nights before the main day of action. These groups
went entirely unnoticed by the police, and put up a massive
amount of posters and graffiti in neighborhoods whose only
source of information on the F.T.A.A. might otherwise have
been the corporate news media.</p>
<p> -Autonomous
direct actions&#8230; One can guess that many affinity groups
organized covert actions in Miami that have not been widely
publicized. A communiqu&eacute; on Indymedia announced that
multiple military recruiting centers had suffered property
destruction. Rumors have circulated about other similar
actions. The powers that be have made a point of keeping
silent about all such activities, of course, and from this
we can deduce that they regard them as a genuine threat
which must not be encouraged by any free publicity.</p>
<p>
-&#8220;The Really Really Free Market&#8221; took place
on the day after the main actions. Hundreds participated
in setting up this working example of a gift economy in
action. Groups set up blankets and booths providing free
stuff from food, art, literature, and music to massages,
new banner dropping methods, funny hats, and healing circles.
This action highlighted our alternatives to &#8220;free&#8221;
trade and capitalism, and showed examples of how human beings
can provide for one another through mutual aid.</p>
<h3>MIAMI
SCORECARD: <br />
What we did, what we didn&#8217;t do, what we
learned . . .</h3>
<p>Before
we conclude, let&#8217;s review some of the goals we have
to choose from whenever we engage in mass direct action:</p>
<p> a.
costing our enemies money and otherwise interfering with
their misdeeds</p>
<p> b.
enjoying the liberating experience of taking on the powers
that be and winning</p>
<p> c.
revealing the capitalist state for what it is by provoking
police repression</p>
<p> d.
learning how to act and apply power in anti-authoritarian
masses</p>
<p> e.
communicating with &#8220;the world&#8221; through mass
media </p>
<p> f.
communicating with locals about the issues</p>
<p> All
these goals were achieved in Seattle, when we had the element
of surprise on our side, and some of them were in Miami&#8212;though
more of them could have been, had we been better prepared
for the approaches we attempted, and augmented them with
other tactics. Attacking the fence, in the presence of such
a police mobilization, was perfect for provoking police
repression, obviously; it was also moderately good for learning
how to act in anti-authoritarian masses, though the police
presence discouraged many from attending and interfered
with our ability to work together freely. We were able to
attract some mass media coverage, for those who value that,
though it was mostly along the spectrum that runs between
&#8220;Murderous Anarchists Hope to Destroy City&#8221;
and &#8220;Harmless Protesters Brutalized by Police,&#8221;
which at best only portrays us as victims and frightens
people away from future protests; the massive police presence
prevented us from doing anything that could have really
grabbed worldwide attention on the news, let alone invested
others with a sense of their own limitless power. The goal
of interacting with locals was achieved in part before and
after the main demonstration by those who took the time
to go around and do so&#8212;though we can always stand
to do better there. Among other things, a more concerted,
extensive effort to get graffiti and posters up around the
area would have avoided the risks posed by police in the
occupied zone, while demonstrating our power and omnipresence
and thus raising morale.</p>
<p> As
for the goal of actually striking effectively against the
powers that be&#8230; considering the massive police presence
around the fence, this would have been better achieved by
small groups operating outside the centers of police occupation,
targeting corporate property and infrastructures efficiently
and stealthily. Had such plans been widely deployed and
successful, they would have achieved many goals: they would
have sent a stern message to both Miami and the world that
hosting such contemptible events will result in great costs;
they would have provided a new model for others in the anti-capitalist
movement to try out themselves, as the older models become
obsolete in the face of new police tactics; our enemies
would have to consider widening the areas and methods of
police surveillance next time, which would cost them more
money, frustrate more citizens, and generally add to their
already acute overextension. The drawback to such covert
activity is that, unlike mass activity, it must be invitation-only,
and thus doesn&#8217;t lend itself to movement-building
or skill-sharing; the main reason to go to a mass action
rather than staying home blowing up banks is to have the
opportunity to work with many others in collective projects
that anyone can join in. On the other hand, many among us
prefer the covert model as a matter of personal taste, plenty
of us know each other well enough to arrange such activities
together, and it&#8217;s no secret that some of our more
experienced folks didn&#8217;t participate in actions in
Miami because the overtly planned activities seemed suicidal
and no covertly planned activities seemed to be in the works.
</p>
<p> So
what did we need in Miami that we didn&#8217;t have? We
should have had more clandestine planning sessions, for
one thing. Direct action should not be planned like civil
disobedience; in order for it to be safe, to elicit the
confidence it needs to succeed, and to be unpredictable
enough to stand a chance of working, it has to be arranged
among friends. No organizing any massive spokescouncil can
do could compensate for the lack of private initiative and
planning, if affinity groups don&#8217;t prepare effectively
amongst themselves. More of us should have been forthcoming
with our own ideas: even those of us already known for our
resourcefulness often hesitate to come forward and actually
organize something, feeling that someone else must already
be doing it or that it must already be too late&#8212;but
all too often it turns out that no one else is working on
the things we&#8217;d like to see happen, and we find out
after it really is too late that the ideas we&#8217;d had
would have worked out perfectly if only they had been tried.
Frequently we end up doing at the last minute what we should
have had the confidence to do ahead of time. If we&#8217;re
going to have to organize groups and lay plans anyway, we
might as well get over our fear of doing these wrong and
just go ahead and try.</p>
<p> Ultimately,
if an effective resistance is to be mounted, all the forces
in a protest have to work together. This means everybody&#8212;from
rank and file workers, puppeteers, and black-clad anarchists,
to dancing Pagans and locals from Overton&#8212;everybody
has to find a way to contribute to what others are doing,
to complement others&#8217; projects without obstructing
or endangering them. The long, steady process of building
this cooperation can&#8217;t be bypassed by communicating
with hierarchies. A single representative from the management
of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. is a poor substitute for actual communication
with union workers. No amount of anti-racist workshops could
possibly substitute for the experience of interacting with
people of different economic and racial backgrounds. Many
of the problems with the protest resulted from people&#8217;s
over-reliance on the spokescouncil to provide some master
plan that would magically coordinate the whole movement.
Of course we need to coordinate in order to work together,
but that isn&#8217;t going to happen if we sit around waiting
for orders at a spokescouncil meeting. We can do this inside
and outside the spokescouncil meeting, months before protest,
in private as well as in more public meetings. Every affinity
group should come to town with a hundred secret plans to
stop the F.T.A.A. single handedly, as well as ideas they
can share with other groups.</p>
<p> But,
to repeat this once more, with the full brunt of the forces
of the terror war being brought to bear against us in Timoney&#8217;s
Miami it was a wonder, albeit a symbolic one, that a single
grappling hook reached the fence at all. If the more confrontational
among us could have wrought more havoc there, it would have
done much to discredit the idea that a militarized force
of any size can succeed in dominating a decentralized, flexible
gathering of freedom-hungry people; all the same, what we
did just by being there at all was impressive and important&#8212;and
maybe enough. </p>
<p> The
difficult time we had in Miami is going to occasion much
discussion of tactics at future demonstrations, but perhaps
that focus is misplaced. Shutting down such meetings was
always a symbolic goal, remember, even when it was possible
by such straightforward means. Now that the government has
to spend eight and a half million dollars every time a ministerial
takes place, and not only paralyze the city but also terrorize
its inhabitants, it might be that they&#8217;re doing our
work for us: the once-secret meetings are impossible to
keep out of the public eye, the &#8220;free&#8221; trade
they concern is associated with massive police repression
and suspension of human rights, and there are more opportunities
than ever for us to bring up our alternative. All we have
to do is show up, cause them enough consternation that they&#8217;ll
have to make the same preparations for the next one, and
get away without unsustainable losses.</p>
<p> Let&#8217;s
be realistic, anyway: although there are improvements we
could have made in our strategizing for mass activity in
downtown Miami&#8212;we could have gotten more militant
people to the fence at once Thursday morning, or turned
the retreat from it that afternoon into a forward march
that was routed to pass by corporate targets, to name two
examples&#8212;there&#8217;s only so much we can accomplish
under such intensive surveillance and repression. But the
fact that they had to spend over eight million dollars to
achieve this is a sign of their weakness, not of their strength&#8212;they
sure can&#8217;t do that everywhere, all the time. It&#8217;s
taken them four years since we won in Seattle to fully develop
their anti-Seattle security system, and by now we should
be ready to move on to the next unexpected line of attack.
We&#8217;ve learned so much about mass activity in the training
ground these summits have provided us&#8212;now we should
take those lessons back to the unguarded environments in
which such tactics first thrived. Next time we succeed in
coming together in great numbers without the police state
getting wind of it in advance, it&#8217;s going to be spectacular.
Let&#8217;s start focusing our energy on how to get people
together for mass action outside the context of international
trade meetings&#8212;let&#8217;s call our own days of action
proactively, organize surprise group activities in our own
communities, even hijack crowded events and turn them into
mass actions. That&#8217;s the future: more unanticipated
covert activity at mass action demonstrations, more unanticipated
mass actions in other settings!</p>
<p> So
what&#8217;s next? For starters, let&#8217;s not forget
to support all the people who were arrested in Miami, especially
the ones with felony charges. They need both emotional support
and assistance with legal costs, and we need to provide
these in abundance so others will not be afraid to take
similar risks in the future. And above all, let&#8217;s
not neglect the work in our own communities that generates
the social foundation from which these efforts grow. Now
is the time to start new infoshops, new outreach programs,
even new anarcho-punk bands. Let&#8217;s plan for the next
massive demonstration such as the G8 in Georgia this June,
or the Republican National Convention in New York City&#8212;just
to be there to keep the heat on them without killing ourselves
or getting all of us in jail, to keep them focused on protecting
themselves from that angle so they won&#8217;t see what&#8217;s
coming at them from the other side&#8230; and perhaps, also,
to try out some new ideas, to show off how much more creative
and powerful and dangerous than them we are.</p>

One Activist&#8217;s Perspective on
<br />
RACE RELATIONS IN THE HEAT OF THE MIAMI PROTESTS</h3>
<p>The
neighborhood closest to the main action was an African-American
ghetto, blasted and impoverished. Not everyone there was
thrilled to have us around at first; walking and riding
around Overtown before the demonstrations, we sometimes
heard locals shout out taunts to the effect of &#8220;let&#8217;s
here it for free trade!&#8221; This didn&#8217;t seem to
be an expression of political or economic principles, but
rather of resentment against the predominantly white outsiders
who were invading their space&#8212;it probably hasn&#8217;t
boded well in the past when a bunch of white folks showed
up in Overtown.</p>
<p> All
the same, considering what we learned later about the misinformation
the police had spread there, the locals were really patient
with us in the days leading up to the action. After all
the chaos was all over and we had made some friends in the
area, an older man wearing a black power t-shirt confided
in us that the police had put the word around Overtown in
advance that people there were encouraged to rob and beat
up activists&#8212;not only would the police turn a blind
eye, but it might even improve their relations with the
community. Our friend explained that no one there trusted
the police, or followed their instructions. All the same,
given the bad impression of white folks in general that
it&#8217;s safe to suppose many in Overtown have, they were
generous not to take advantage of the opportunity to try
to redistribute a little wealth.</p>
<p> Encouraging
locals to assault activists was not the only way our enemies
rolled out the red carpet for us. The first time I walked
through Overtown, I was approached by a small crowd of children
who asked me how much I was getting paid. This was perplexing
to me. I answered that as I had been unemployed since 1994,
I wasn&#8217;t getting paid anything. They persisted in
asking the question, until I finally answered that the last
time I was getting paid, I&#8217;d been getting five dollars
an hour, under the table. Satisfied, they went away; but
I heard this question over and over, and I soon figured
out what it meant: the rumor had been spread thoroughly
that we protesters were being paid to protest. For folks
who live in dire poverty and have to deal with police harassment
constantly, it would make sense to conclude that white folks
who presumably have an easier time getting work and wouldn&#8217;t
otherwise be on the receiving end of so much police attention
must be doing it for some financial incentive; but the rumor
was so widely disseminated that it couldn&#8217;t have just
been a hypothesis somebody came up with. In my opinion,
it must have been spread in advance as disinformation. It
certainly made us look less like crusaders for global justice
and potential allies in the struggle, that at first everyone
who saw us thought we were there gentrifying their neighborhood
on salary.</p>
<p> All
these strikes against us notwithstanding, the attitudes
of Overtown residents towards us changed dramatically as
soon as we were in open conflict with the police. As we
retreated into Overtown ahead of the police onslaught Thursday
afternoon, everyone we passed cheered us on&#8212;most people
had come out onto the street to see what was going on, and
now that they saw we shared a common enemy with them, one
who was attacking us as if we were a real threat, they embraced
us as friends. Several people I briefly spoke with encouraged
us to step up our level of confrontation with the police&#8212;the
implications were that if we could escalate the conflict,
they would join in. That makes sense&#8212;though they have
every reason to revolt, people who suffer poverty and constant
police repression already are not going to engage in an
uprising unless it looks like it is going to work. For a
moment that afternoon, I could imagine what would happen
if we somehow were able to hold our ground against the police
and create a space for the residents of Overtown to join
in. That happened in Quebec&#8212;I remember a local throwing
a snowball at the riot police there a couple hours before
all the locals joined in showering the cops with projectiles,
just as a man in Overtown was seen throwing a football at
the pigs in his neighborhood that afternoon&#8212;it can
happen anywhere people are angry, if resistance can reach
critical mass.</p>
<p> Unfortunately,
we were fleeing in disarray and desperation from the most
militarized police force North America has ever seen, in
no condition for touching off the sequel to the L.A. riots
of 1992. The most we could hope for was to get out of the
situation without concussions or handcuffing scars. Before
we&#8217;d arrived at the inhabited areas of Overtown, we&#8217;d
been pulling dumpsters and other obstacles into the street
to slow the police advance; encouraged by the support we
were receiving, we decided to ask around how people on the
street felt about us doing that there. Everyone said they
felt fine about it; two of us began pushing another dumpster
into the middle of the road.</p>
<p> At
that point, out of nowhere, a large black man wearing a
jacket with an American flag on the back came charging up
at us, screaming and waving a two by four. I managed to
get between him and my friends and defuse things enough
for all of us to get away with only superficial injuries,
but the important thing was that we had miscalculated our
place in the situation. Looking around at the people who
had just given us the go-ahead, I saw them shaking their
heads at the guy who was attacking us, but also withdrawing
some of their unconditional permission for us to be there
fighting the police now that it was causing internal strife
in their community.</p>
<p> That
experience was a reminder that although folks who are really
suffering under capitalism don&#8217;t have reason to trust
us as allies until we are actively challenging its power,
we also have to be careful in the process not to make things
any more difficult for them than they are. They didn&#8217;t
mind the police chasing us into their neighborhood, by and
large&#8212;the police were going to be there anyway, and
it was a relief that they were there pursuing white folks
for once, rather than locals; but when our interactions
with them resulted in drama among the residents, that was
a problem. It also drove home the point that you can&#8217;t
consider the opinions of any demographic in one bloc; everyone
we&#8217;d talked to was in favor of us making barricades,
but that didn&#8217;t mean &#8220;the people of Overtown&#8221;
were in favor of it, it just meant certain ones were. Whenever
people of one background try to consider the perspectives
of people from another&#8212;especially when white activists
do so, I&#8217;m afraid&#8212;it is all too easy to summarize
and oversimplify.</p>
<p> That
episode passed quickly, but by then we were surrounded&#8212;police
on all the streets around us. We ran down an alley, only
to see with dismay that they had closed off the street ahead
of us too. In a matter of seconds, a full line of police
cars blocked every street around us from corner to corner,
and police on foot were arresting every activist in range.
We hunkered down in the alley, trying quixotically to hide
between the scattered weeds at the foot of a chain-link
fence, a veritable lightshow of blue and red reflecting
off the brick wall facing us. A helicopter swooped low overhead.
It seemed it was all over.</p>
<p> At
this moment, just as we were trying most desperately to
will ourselves invisible, a couple local kids came into
the alley and walked up to us, hands in their sweatshirt
pockets as if they were pretending to hold guns with which
to rob us. They quickly abandoned this half-hearted charade,
however, and started asking us questions about what we were
doing. At first, of course, we had to explain that we weren&#8217;t
being paid to protest&#8212;something that I&#8217;m sure
was becoming clearer by the second anyway. Then we explained&#8212;succinctly,
and not without a little impatience lest our new friends&#8217;
presence attract the attention of our riot-armored foes&#8212;what
we were doing there, and asked their advice as to how we
could extricate ourselves from the situation. There wasn&#8217;t
much they could tell us&#8212;being completely surrounded
in foreign territory by thousands of armored police whose
specific goal is to beat and incarcerate you is a toughie
however you look at it. Eventually they wished us luck and
moved on.</p>
<p> We
spent a tense hour and a half in that alley, waiting for
the sun to go down and the police lines to break up so we
could make a dash for safety. Long after darkness had fallen,
the lights were still flashing all around us, and police
still marching past both mouths of the alley, and the helicopter
was still overhead, now scanning the alley with its spotlight.
Those were some tense minutes for all of us&#8212;except
the member of our party who had spent an entire sleepless
week volunteering at the convergence center, who actually
took advantage of the situation to nod off for a while!
The only explanation I can come up with for why they never
came into the alley to arrest us is that, for the whole
duration of the protests, the police never moved in groups
of fewer than thirty, and in that &#8220;dangerous&#8221;
neighborhood they feared to break up their numbers to pick
off stragglers. I recount this story here in case it may
be useful to others trying to escape under similar circumstances
one day&#8212;heaven help us, such circumstances are getting
more and more common.</p>
<p> Finally
the police forces moved on, and we made our way out onto
the street two at a time, without any incriminating material,
in the cutest boy-girl couples we were able to throw together
(these work for getting through police lines, I swear&#8212;hold
hands, look deep into each other&#8217;s eyes a lot, focus
on seeming harmless&#8212;earlier that day a companion and
I had penetrated the police defenses as far as the front
door of the hotel hosting the ministerial, thanks to our
lovebirds masquerade). There we found locals waiting to
guide us to safety, freely telling us where the police lines
were now and offering to lead us down the safest routes.
Trapped inside police lines, fearing almost for our lives,
nothing could have been sweeter mercy than this. Thanks
in no small part to their help; we arrived back safe at
the convergence center an hour later, grateful to be free
and alive.</p>
<p> Our
guides, of course, inquired if we had any money, and we
penniless anti-capitalists scrounged in our pockets to see
if there was any leftover subway change to share. I emphasized
to one of them that there was no price that could be placed
on such assistance, and she let me know she would have done
it for free, needless to say, as she wanted the same things
we wanted. All the same, the situation&#8212;basically paying
a native guide to lead us out of a dangerous situation,
as if we were in wartime Morocco or something&#8212;was
a reminder of how much economic inequality there still is
even between people on the outside of the capitalist system.
What I&#8217;d give to live to see a day when the means
she has access to and the means I have access to are no
different, to never have to wonder again to what extent
I&#8217;m being regarded as a potential source of income
rather than a fellow human being!</p>
<p> That&#8217;s
what we&#8217;re fighting for, when we contest our enemies&#8217;
free trade conventions and economic power in general. Next
time we need to make it clearer to locals in advance what
we&#8217;re trying to do, so we won&#8217;t have quite as
much misinformation and misunderstandings to cut through
to find common ground. If we can get a full-scale anarchist
insurrection going in any city in this empire, there are
millions who will join in, who need it even worse than we
do&#8212;but we have to work towards this conscientiously,
with an acute awareness of the challenges other communities
face, and in constant dialogue as to what our role in the
larger struggle should be.</p>
<p> I&#8217;ll
conclude with the letter some friends distributed in Overtown
after the demonstrations were over. Good for them&#8212;let&#8217;s
see more of that!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4> An
open letter to the residents of Overtown from some F.T.A.A.
protestors:</h4>
<p> Thank
You Very Much!</p>
<p> Over
the last week there were times when anti-F.T.A.A. protestors
were pushed into Overtown by the police. We want people
to know:</p>
<p> 1)
We had no intention to bring any heat into your neighborhood.
In fact, many of us talked about the need to not do that.</p>
<p> 2)
We very much appreciate all the help and moral support we
received from hundreds of residents.</p>
<p> 3)
We understand that the police brutality we experienced is
just a small slice of what poor people of color deal with
everyday. We recognize this system is racist. We are dedicated
to smashing racism and the system behind it.</p>
<p> 4)
We oppose the F.T.A.A. because it is an attempt by the rich
to exert even more control over all of our lives. It is
also the continuation of the colonial relationships that
have been enslaving, killing and stealing land for over
500 years.</p>
<p> 5)
We know there are a lot more problems than the F.T.A.A.
We are against the entire greedy corporate-military-police-war
machine that oppresses life. We are for community empowerment,
self-determination, justice and total liberation. ALL POWER
TO THE PEOPLE!</p>
