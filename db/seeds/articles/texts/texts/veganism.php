<h1>Veganism.</h1>
<p> What I find sorely lacking in most of the discussions of veganism I
encounter in hardcore is any sense of economic context. Usually, the question
of animal oppression is approached only in terms of compassion and prejudice:
animals are exploited and destroyed, bands like Earth Crisis would have
us believe, simply because we see them as subhuman and are willing to
abuse them in order to satisfy our greed. I suspect that the problem runs
much deeper than mere cruelty and avarice. Under capitalism, it's not
just animals that are exploited&#151;it's everyone and everything from farmlands
and forests to farmhands and grocery clerks. The oppression of animals
is just a little more obvious to us because it involves the murder of
living things; but it's not just animals that have been enslaved and transformed
by our society, it's everything, ourselves included. Without an understanding
of how and why our social/economic system drives us to seek to dominate
and exploit everything, we will not be able to alter the way animals are
treated in any significant or long-lasting way. Capitalism forces us to
evaluate our environment and each other according to market value. Under
the capitalist system, every man is encouraged to ask the question of
how useful the animals and people around him might be as economic resources
in his competition with others. Everything becomes fair game for exploitation—because
if you don't exploit something in the rush to gain the upper hand in the
free market's "exchange of goods and services," someone else will exploit
it, and quite possibly use it to exploit you. Those who have realized
this are not afraid to exploit animals or humans, to treat them as objects,
because they believe that the alternative is to be treated as objects
and exploited by others themselves. In this way, capitalism divides us
against each other and spurs on our destruction of the environment. </p>
<p> When I walk through the aisles at the supermarket, looking at all the
products for sale around me, perhaps I can tell which ones are manufactured
from the exploitation of animals, but I can't tell which ones&#151;if any&#151;are
manufactured without exploiting anyone or anything. That is one of the
biggest drawbacks about our modern mass-production/distribution/consumption
economy: by the time the product has reached you, it is virtually impossible
to tell who made it, how it was made, what it was made from, or where
it has been. Toilet paper, canned kidney beans, and athletic shoes all
sit on the shelves next to each other, as if they appeared out of the
air, and it would be a long hard struggle to track down any real, sound
information about the origins of any of them. But there are some things
I do know, though, even if I can't research the life story of each individual
packet of ramen noodles: there are migrant workers in this country who
are underpaid and mistreated, there are corporations (like Pepsi) known
for supporting totalitarian governments that mercilessly destroy human
life, there are shoe manufacturers (like Nike) that underpay and mistreat
foreign workers, there are companies (like Exxon) whose policies result
in permanent damage to the environment. So the idea that you can be sure
that your dollars are not financing anything inhumane or destructive just
by examining the ingrediants of a product and ascertaining that it includes
no animal products strikes me as absurd. There are a thousand other kinds
of oppression, just as outrageous as animal oppression, that keep the
wheels of our economy turning, and there is no reason to be less concerned
about any of them than about animal oppression. </p>
<p> It seems to me that the long term solution to this problem is not just
to buy vegan food and animal-friendly products. If we want to change the
conditions that have resulted in the widespread destruction and exploitation
that characterize our world, we must work towards a complete overhauling
of our economy&#151;we must somehow escape from the vicious cycle of capitalism.
The only way to fight capitalism is to undermine its assumptions: that
happiness is having things ("the one who dies with the most toys wins"),
that there is no realistic way to work with each other rather than competing
against each other, that any other economic system means some kind of
slavery (like the former communist U.S.S.R.). If these assumptions are
untrue, which isn't hard to imagine, then it should be possible for us
to create a different kind of economy and a different kind of world. If
people start to conceive of happiness as the freedom to do things rather
than have things, if they decide that they enjoy being generous more than
being selfish, if they can imagine that it might be possible to create
a society in which we work together for the good of everybody rather than
against each other and the environment for (what advertisements claim
is) our own good, then capitalism will ultimately fall. </p>
<p> In the meantime, rather than practising veganism, I practise "freeganism."
I know that as long as I participate in the mainstream economy, whether
I am buying vegan or non-vegan products, I am supporting the corporations
which represent world capitalism. So rather than just buying animal-friendly
products, I try to purchase as few products as possible. I've written
about this in earlier issues of Inside Front: it is possible, through
thrifty living, creative "urban hunting and gathering," and projects like
Food Not Bombs, to survive without contributing more than a minimal amount
of money or labor to the mainstream economy. Anything I can get for free
at the expense of the exploiting, oppressing capitalist system is a strike
against that system, while purchasing vegan food from Taco Bell (which
is owned by Pepsi Co.) is still putting money into the hands of an oppressive,
exploiting corporation. I live off of whatever resources I can scrounge
or steal from our society, trying to avoid animal products when I can,
but concentrating above all on keeping my money and labor out of of their
hands. A willingness to pump money into the mainstream economy, which
is responsible for the oppression of animals and humans and the destruction
of the environment, through consumer spending (on fashionable athletic
clothes, for example), is not compatible with the professed goal of most
people who follow a vegan diet, which is to end the exploitation of animals.
That's why it strikes me as ridiculous that so many vegan activist bands
like Earth Crisis are willing to perpetuate fashion consciousness in hardcore
by selling so much merchandise&#151;and by speaking only about human cruelty
rather than criticizing consumerism in general, they ignore the real causes
of animal oppression. </p>
<p> There are some great things about veganism, by the way. First of all,
if you can't bear to put anything into your body that was actually made
from the corpse of another living being, veganism is a way to avoid that
(although it DOES NOT magically confer the "innocence" of animal exploitation
that hardline morons claim for themselves, as my discussion of capitalism
and other forms of oppression should make clear). Also, it gives you a
different relationship to the food you eat than most of us have: it makes
you consider where it came from and what's in it, rather than just taking
it for granted, and it also will probably make you a better cook! And
finally, it brings up the issue for everybody. When you won't eat food
unless you know what is in it, it forces the people around you to think
for themselves about what is in the food and how it got there. In that
way, veganism does more to change the world than writing lengthy political
responses to letters ever could: it brings up important questions in everyday
life and forces people think about questions that they wouldn't otherwise
encounter. </p>
