<h1>No Gods</h1>
<p> Once, flipping through a book on child psychology, I came across a chapter
about adolescent rebellion. It suggested that in the first phase of a
child's youthful rebellion against her parents, she may attempt to distinguish
herself from them by accusing them of not living up to their own values.
For example, if they taught her that kindness and consideration are important,
she will accuse them of not being compassionate enough. In this case the
child has not yet defined herself or her own values; she still accepts
the values and ideas that her parents passed on to her, and she is only
able to assert her identity inside of that framework. It is only later,
when she questions the very beliefs and morals that were presented to
her as gospel, that she can become a free-standing individual. </p>
<p> I often think that we have not gotten beyond that first stage of rebellion
in the hardcore scene. We criticize the actions of those in the mainstream
and the effects of their society upon people and animals, we attack the
ignorance and cruelty of their system, but we rarely stop to question
the nature of what we all accept as "morality." Could it be that this
"morality," by which we think we can judge their actions, is itself something
that should be criticized? When we claim that the exploitation of animals
is "morally wrong," what does that mean? Are we perhaps just accepting
their values and turning these values against them, rather than creating
moral standards of our own? </p>
<p> Maybe right now you're saying to yourself "what do you mean, create
moral standards of our own? Something is either morally right or it isn't&#151;morality
isn't something you can make up, it's not a matter of mere opinion." Right
there, you're accepting one of the most basic tenets of the society that
raised you: that right and wrong are not individual valuations, but fundamental
laws of the world. This idea, a holdover from a deceased Christianity,
is at the center of our civilization. If you are going to question the
establishment, you should question it first! </p>
<p> There is no such thing as good or evil<br>
There is no universal right or wrong<br>
There is only you...<br>
and the values you choose for yourself. </p>
<h3>Where does the idea of &ldquo;Moral Law&rdquo; come from?</h3>
<p> Once upon a time, almost everyone believed in the existence of God.
This God ruled over the world, He had absolute power over everything in
it; and He had set down laws which all human beings had to obey. If they
did not, they would suffer the most terrible of punishments at His hands.
Naturally, most people obeyed the laws as well as they could, their fear
of eternal suffering being stronger than their desire for anything forbidden.
Because everyone lived according to the same laws, they could agree upon
what "morality" was: it was the set of values decreed by God's laws. Thus,
good and evil, right and wrong, were decided by the authority of God,
which everyone accepted out of fear. </p>
<p> One day, people began to wake up and realize that there was no such
thing as God after all. There was no scientific evidence to demonstrate
his existence, and few people could see any point in having faith in the
irrational any longer. God pretty much disappeared from the world; nobody
feared him or his punishments anymore. </p>
<p> But a strange thing happened. Though these people had the courage to
question God's existence, and even deny it to the ones who still believed
in it, they didn't dare to question the morality that His laws had mandated.
Perhaps it just didn't occur to them; everyone had been raised to hold
the same beliefs about what was moral, and had come to speak about right
and wrong in the same way, so maybe they just assumed it was obvious what
was good and what was evil whether God was there to enforce it or not.
Or perhaps people had become to used to living under these laws that they
were afraid to even consider the possibility that the laws didn't exist
any more than God did. </p>
<p> This left humanity in an unusual position: though there was no longer
an authority to decree certain things absolutely right or wrong, they
still accepted the idea that some things were right or wrong by nature.
Though they no longer had faith in a deity, they still had faith in a
universal moral code that everyone had to follow. Though they no longer
believed in God, they were not yet courageous enough to stop obeying His
orders; they had abolished the idea of a divine ruler, but not the divinity
of His code of ethics. This unquestioning submission to the laws of a
long-departed heavenly master has been a long nightmare from which the
human race is only just now beginning to awaken. </p>
<h3> God is dead&#151;and with him, Moral law</h3>
<p> Without God, there is no longer any objective standard by which to judge
good and evil. This realization was very troubling to philosophers a few
decades ago, but it hasn't really had much of an effect in other circles.
Most people still seem to think that a universal morality can be grounded
in something other than God's laws: in what is good for people, in what
is good for society, in what we feel called upon to do. But explanations
of why these standards necessarily constitute "universal moral law" are
hard to come by. Usually, the arguments for the existence of moral law
are emotional rather than rational: "But don't you think rape is wrong?"
moralists ask, as if a shared opinion were a proof of universal truth.
"But don't you think people need to believe in something greater than
themselves?" they appeal, as if needing to believe in something can make
it true. Occasionally, they even resort to threats: "but what would happen
if everyone decided that there is no good or evil? Wouldn't we all kill
each other?" </p>
<p> The real problem with the idea of universal moral law is that it asserts
the existence of something that we have no way to know anything about.
Believers in good and evil would have us believe that there are "moral
truths"&#151;that is, there are things that are morally true of this world,
in the same way that it is true that the sky is blue. They claim that
it is true of this world that murder is morally wrong just as it is true
that water freezes at thirty two degrees. But we can investigate the freezing
temperature of water scientifically: we can measure it and agree together
that we have arrived at some kind of objective truth [that is, insofar
as it is possible to speak of objective truth, for you postmodernist motherfuckers!].
On the other hand, what do we observe if we want to investigate whether
it is true that murder is evil? There is no tablet of moral law on a mountaintop
for us to consult, there are no commandments carved into the sky above
us; all we have to go on are our own instincts and the words of a bunch
of priests and other self-appointed moral experts, many of whom don't
even agree. As for the words of the priests and moralists, if they can't
offer any hard evidence from this world, why should we believe their claims?
And regarding our instincts&#151;if we feel that something is right or wrong,
that may make it right or wrong for us, but that's not proof that it is
universally good or evil. Thus, the idea that there are universal moral
laws is mere superstition: it is a claim that things exist in this world
which we can never actually experience or learn anything about. And we
would do well not to waste our time wondering about things we can never
know anything about. When two people fundamentally disagree over what
is right or wrong, there is no way to resolve the debate. There is nothing
in this world to which they can refer to see which one is correct&#151;because
there really are no universal moral laws, just personal evaluations. So
the only important question is where your values come from: do you create
them yourself, according to your own desires, or do you accept them from
someone else... someone else who has disguised their opinions as "universal
truths"? </p>
<p> Haven't you always been a little suspicious of the idea of universal
moral truths, anyway? This world is filled with groups and individuals
who want to convert you to their religions, their dogmas, their political
agendas, their opinions. Of course they will tell you that one set of
values is true for everybody, and of course they will tell you that their
values are the correct ones. Once you're convinced that there is only
one standard of right and wrong, they're only a step away from convincing
you that their standard is the right one. How carefully we should approach
those who would sell us the idea of "universal moral law," then! Their
claim that morality is a matter of universal law is probably just a sneaky
way to get us to accept their values rather than forging our own, which
might conflict with theirs. </p>
<p> So, to protect ourselves from the superstitions of the moralists and
the trickery of the evangelists, let us be done with the idea of moral
law. Let us step forward into a new era, in which we will make values
of our own rather than accepting moral laws out of fear and obedience.
Let this be our new creed: There is no universal moral code that should
dictate human behavior. There is no such thing as good or evil, there
is no universal standard of right and wrong. Our values and morals come
from us and belong to us, whether we like it or not; so we should claim
them proudly for ourselves, as our own creations, rather than seeking
some external justification for them. </p>
<h4>But if there's no good or evil, if nothing has any intrinsic moral value,
how do we know what to do?</h4>
<p> Make your own good and evil. If there is no moral law standing over
us, that means we're free&#151;free to do whatever we want, free to be whatever
we want, free to pursue our desires without feeling any guilt or shame
about them. Figure out what it is you want in your life, and go for it;
create whatever values are right for you, and live by them. It won't be
easy, by any means; desires pull in different directions, they come and
go without warning, so keeping up with them and choosing among them is
a difficult task&#151;of course obeying instructions is easier, less complicated.
But if we just live our lives as we have been instructed to, the chances
are very slim that we will get what we want out of life: each of us is
different and has different needs, so how could one set of "moral truths"
work for each of us? If we take responsibility for ourselves and each
carve our own table of values, then we will have a fighting chance of
attaining some measure of happiness. The old moral laws are left over
from days when we lived in fearful submission to a nonexistent God, anyway;
with their departure, we can rid ourselves of all the cowardice, submission,
and superstition that has characterized our past. </p>
<p> Some misunderstand the claim that we should pursue our own desires to
be mere hedonism. But it is not the fleeting, insubstantial desires of
the typical libertine that we are speaking about here. It is the strongest,
deepest, most lasting desires and inclinations of the individual: it is
her most fundamental loves and hates that should shape her values. And
the fact that there is no God to demand that we love one another or act
virtuously does not mean that we should not do these things for our own
sake, if we find them rewarding, which almost all of us do. But let us
do what we do for our own sake, not out of obedience to some deity or
moral code! </p>
<h4>But how can we justify acting on our ethics, if we can't base
them on universal moral truths?</h4>
<p> Morality has been something justified externally for so long that today
we hardly know how to conceive of it in any other way. We have always
had to claim that our values proceeded from something external to us,
because basing values on our own desires was (not surprisingly!) branded
evil by the preachers of moral law. Today we still feel instinctively
that our actions must be justified by something outside of ourselves,
something "greater" than ourselves&#151;if not by God, then by moral law, state
law, public opinion, justice, "love of man," etc. We have been so conditioned
by centuries of asking permission to feel things and do things, of being
forbidden to base any decisions on our own needs, that we still want to
think we are obeying some higher power even when we act on our own desires
and beliefs; somehow, it seems more defensible to act out of submission
to some kind of authority than in the service of our own inclinations.
We feel so ashamed of our own aspirations and desires that we would rather
attribute our actions to something "higher" than them. But what could
be greater than our own desires, what could possibly provide better justification
for our actions? Should we be serving something external without consulting
our desires, perhaps even against our desires? </p>
<p> This question of justification is where so many hardcore bands have
gone wrong. They attack what they see as injustice not on the grounds
that they don't want to see such things happen, but on the grounds that
it is "morally wrong." By doing so, they seek the support of everyone
who still believes in the fable of moral law, and they get to see themselves
as servants of the Truth. These hardcore bands should not be taking advantage
of popular delusions to make their points, but should be challenging assumptions
and questioning traditions in everything they do. An improvement in, for
example, animal rights, which is achieved in the name of justice and morality,
is a step forward at the cost of two steps back: it solves one problem
while reproducing and reinforcing another. Certainly such improvements
could be fought for and attained on the grounds that they are desirable
(nobody who truly considered it would really want to needlessly slaughter
and mistreat animals, would they?), rather than with tactics leftover
from Christian superstition. Unfortunately, because of centuries of conditioning,
it feels so good to feel justified by some "higher force," to be obeying
"moral law," to be enforcing "justice" and fighting "evil" that these
bands get caught up in their role as moral enforcers and forget to question
whether the idea of moral law makes sense in the first place. There is
a sensation of power that comes from believing that one is serving a higher
authority, the same one that attracts people to fascism. It's always tempting
to paint any struggle as good against evil, right against wrong; but that
is not just an oversimplification, it is a falsification: for no such
things exist. We can act compassionately towards each other because we
want to, not just because "morality dictates," you know! We don't need
any justification from above to care about animals and humans, or to act
to protect them. We need only to feel in our hearts that it is right,
that it is right for us, to have all the reason we need. Thus we can justify
acting on our ethics without basing them on moral truths simply by not
being ashamed of our desires: by being proud enough of them to accept
them for what they are, as the forces that drive us as individuals. And
our own values might not be right for everyone, it's true; but they are
all each of us has to go on, so we should dare to act on them rather than
wishing for some impossible greater justification. </p>
<h4> But what would happen if everyone decided that there
is no good or evil? Wouldn't we all kill each other? </h4>
<p> This question presupposes that people refrain from killing each other
only because they have been taught that it is evil to do so. Is humanity
really so absolutely bloodthirsty and vicious that we would all rape and
kill each other if we weren't restrained by superstition? It seems more
likely to me that we desire to get along with each other at least as much
as we desire to be destructive&#151;don't you usually enjoy helping others
more than you enjoy hurting them? Today, most people claim to believe
that compassion and fairness are morally right, but this has done little
to make the world into a compassionate and fair place. Might it not be
true that we would act upon our natural inclinations to human decency
more, rather than less, if we did not feel that charity and justice were
obligatory? What would it really be worth, anyway, if we did all fulfill
our "duty" to be good to each other, if it was only because we were obeying
moral imperatives? Wouldn't it mean a lot more for us to treat each other
with consideration because we want to, rather than because we feel required
to? </p>
<p>And if the abolition of the myth of moral law somehow causes more
strife between human beings, won't that still be better than living as
slaves to superstitions? If we make our own minds up about what our values
are and how we will live according to them, we at least will have the
chance to pursue our desires and perhaps enjoy life, even if we have to
struggle against each other. But if we choose to live according to rules
set for us by others, we sacrifice the chance to choose our destinies
and pursue our dreams. No matter how smoothly we might get along in the
shackles of moral law, is it worth the abdication of our self determination?
I wouldn't have the heart to lie to a fellow human being and tell him
he had to conform to some ethical mandate whether it was in his best interest
or not, even if that lie would prevent a conflict between us. Because
I care about human beings, I want them to be free to do what is right
for them. Isn't that more important than mere peace on earth? Isn't freedom,
even dangerous freedom, preferable to the safest slavery, to peace bought
with ignorance, cowardice, and submission? </p>
<p> Besides, look back at our history. So much bloodshed, deception, and
oppression has already been perpetrated in the name of right and wrong.
The bloodiest wars have been fought between opponents who each thought
they were fighting on the side of moral truth. The idea of moral law doesn't
help us get along, it turns us against each other, to contend over whose
moral law is the "true" one. There can be no real progress in human relations
until everyone's perspectives on ethics and values are acknowledged; then
we can finally begin to work out our differences and learn to live together,
without fighting over the absolutely stupid question of whose values and
desires are "right." For your own sake, for the sake of humanity, cast
away the antiquated notions of good and evil and create your values for
yourself! </p>
