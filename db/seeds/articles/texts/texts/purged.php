<h6>DISPATCH FROM THE CRIMETHINC. CENTRAL COMMITTEE<br />
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:</h6>
<h1>ALL TRAVELER KIDS<br />
PURGED FROM CRIMETHINC.
MEMBERSHIP</h1>
<p><em>Quitting your job was about having more time to do what
needs doing, not just isolating yourself from the rest of
humanity&#8212;wasn&#8217;t it?</em></p>
<p>
<em>If one makes propaganda extolling what is revolutionary
about shoplifting, one is not necessarily trying to get
would-be revolutionaries to shoplift so they can be &#8220;more
revolutionary&#8221; [obviously a stupid approach if there
ever was one&#8212;although exploring the tactical benefits
of shoplifting for a class of people looking to do less
buying might make sense]&#8212;one might instead be trying
to identify for shoplifters what is already insurrectionary
in their actions, so they can broaden their analysis of
their own lives.</em></p><p><em>
Crimethought is not any ideology or value system or lifestyle,
but rather a way of challenging all ideologies and value
systems and lifestyles&#8212;and, for the advanced agent,
a way of making all ideologies, value systems, and lifestyles
challenging. It is not crimethought just to survive without
a job by dumpstering, squatting, and hitchhiking; it is
crimethought to realize that this lifestyle provides resources
that can be used to revolutionize demonstration activism,
or underground literature. It is not crimethought simply
to distribute propaganda attacking the monotony and limited
options of traditional employment; it is crimethought to
create situations in which both workers and ex-workers benefit
from each others&#8217; different experiences, and consequently
discover new options and new adventures that were previously
obscured.</em></p>

The Stalinists, Surrealists, Situationists, and even Southern
Baptists all had their bloody purges and internal dissensions,
so why can&#8217;t we, too? Having no membership should
be no obstacle: we can still hold exclusions from time to
time, just to be sure everyone remembers. These are festive
occasions for us weathered politicos, analagous to the subtextual
backbiting at the dinner parties of the bourgeoisie or the
witch trials in the Salem, Massachusetts of old. But first,
before we get into the firey self-righteousness of the thing,
some background.</p><p>
It&#8217;s been nearly a year now since I went through my
entire proofing copy of the <em>Evasion</em> book in the
dark back seat of a Greyhound traveling by night, with only
my trendy activist headlamp for light. Even then, we knew
already what the greatest drawback of publishing it in book
form would be: all the general ideas in <em>Days of War,
Nights of Love</em>, the inspirations and analyses and especially
the rhetoric calculated to encourage revolt, would now be
summed up in some minds by the specific formula spelled
out by the stories in this new book. Even though <em>Evasion</em>
is not a work of political theory, or a prescription of
tactics, but clearly a personal account, a memoir&#8212;even
though we&#8217;ve mantained from the beginning that there
is no single strategy for insurgency, but that everyone
must invent and reinvent their own&#8212;it was inevitable
that we would be misunderstood by some, and we accepted
that in publishing the book.</p><p>
In publishing it, we wanted&#8212;to articulate this for
the thousandth and last time&#8212;to introduce an account
(one of many) of work-free living to a wider readership,
and thus challenge conventional notions about the sanctity
of property and the misery of material poverty. With this
cultural warfare, we hoped to do our part to expand the
anticapitalist movement. Sharing particular scams, extoling
the lifestyle of the scam artist, these were secondary goals
at best. The &#8216;zine had already been produced and distributed
on as massive a scale as the infrastructure of our d.i.y.
underground allowed, to the demographics who would be most
likely to utilize its scams and emulate the author&#8217;s
life choices; we printed the book version to see if this
narrative of refusal and adventure could sow other seeds
outside its native environment. Some of the feedback we&#8217;ve
received from beyond the existing activist and anarchist
communities suggests that it has; but now it&#8217;s time
to shake off whatever success we&#8217;ve achieved, as one
must always do to make space for new attempts.</p><p>
And to speak, for the last time as well, of how our efforts,
with this book and other projects, have been misunderstood.
There is a certain kind of reader who, though you do your
best to bring out the subtleties and ironies, will always
focus on the most superficial, controversial terms in your
works, and interpret your complex critiques as simple dismissals
and endorsements (&#8220;paying=bad,&#8221; &#8220;shoplifting=good&#8221;&#8212;or,
far worse, &#8220;=anticapitalist&#8221;). Whether he professes
to be your adversary or accomplice, it is best to avoid
him altogether, for he will lower the level of dialogue
on any issue to his own low denominator&#8212;and at that
elevation, little of value can be discussed or achieved.
Perhaps we can be blamed, in part, for creating some of
these readers, by producing material that was too simplistic
or too complex; perhaps this kind of reader is simply too
rampant today to be altogether avoided by even the nimblest
of propagandist&#8217;s pens. One certainly can&#8217;t
say enough, though, that nothing in the world is one-dimensional.</p><p>
So while this, too, has been said a million times, perhaps
it will do some good to say it again in this context: the
traveler kid lifestyle is not in itself at all revolutionary.
It may surprise some to hear this from us&#8212;that shows
how little they&#8217;ve been listening all along. Shoplifting,
hitchhiking, scamming, unemployment&#8212;separated from
a program of life- and world-transformation, all these are
merely alternative tools for survival, a survival which
makes do with and ultimately accepts the status quo. Yes,
it <em>is</em> better, however infinitesimally, to steal
products than to give money to our executioners&#8212;but
it&#8217;s not enough! Three millenia of shoplifting now,
and the exchange economy is still thriving. If it&#8217;s
life we&#8217;re after, not mere survival, as the old dichotomy
goes, we can&#8217;t just sit tight now in our squats and
punkhouses, eating dumpstered bagels and selling our shoplifted
wares on e-bay; we have to keep on risking everything to
challenge the system that denies us the <em>rest</em> of
the world, if for nothing else at least to continue challenging
ourselves.</p><p>
For the record, and to briskly repudiate every imbecile
who has used &#8220;CrimethInc.&#8221; as a synonym for
scamming and freeloading, we&#8217;ve never been interested
in being or being seen as partisans of any lifestyle; we&#8217;ve
always insisted that being radical involves subverting all
possible lifestyle choices, all traditional strategies and
identities. Revolution occurs when some part of the social
equation changes: when apolitical workers initiate a wildcat
strike, when middle-aged mothers start to show up in the
black bloc beside their sons and daughters, when vagabond
dropouts integrate themselves into local struggles for affordable
housing. The letters we receive from adult secretaries who
have used CrimethInc. literature to inspire themselves to
change their lives are infinitely more encouraging to me
than the scores of teenagers reading<em> Harbinger</em>
as they set out on the hitchhiking excursions young folks
always have. Not that there is anything wrong with being
a hitchhiking teenager&#8212;but to be a <em>dangerous</em>
hitchhiking teenager, you must do something more than simply
hitchhike, and interpreting anticapitalist texts as glorifications
of your hitchhiking doesn&#8217;t count.</p><p>
I hopped my very first train just a few weeks ago, after
nearly eight straight years of unemployment and anticapitalist
agitation. For most of that time, I was never much of a
hitch-hiking, train-hopping, scam-pulling traveler kid,
and neither were most of the individuals I collaborated
with&#8212;there are, believe it or not, a wide variety
of other lifestyles that are equally conducive to such endeavors.
The historical intersection of the latest wave of youth
nomadism with the propaganda groups like ours have been
spreading is, in some ways, unfortunate; it has had some
good effects, but it has also made it easier for people
to dismiss some radical ideas as the alibis of a new youth
trend&#8212;or, worse, to believe that they are being radical
simply by joining such a trend!</p><p>
The creation of subcultural ghettos, the reinterpretation
of subversive acts as promotions of some alternative lifestyle&#8212;these
are processes by which opposition and subversion have been
repeatedly neutralized over the past four decades, if not
centuries. Yes, it is critical that we build new communities,
with new cultural values and approaches, and that we not
belittle these as &#8220;mere subcultures&#8221; when they
do arise&#8212;for it is in these communities that we can
develop and sustain a resistance, and create a context in
which to lead free lives. It is also critical that we keep
challenging these communities, that they do not become stagnant
or self-satisfied: for as long as we are all under the great
thumb, freedom is always for all or none.</p><p>
CrimethInc., and for that matter (and far more important)
crimethink, are not membership organizations, anyway. Subverting
is not something you <em>are</em>, it&#8217;s something
you <em>do</em>, and must find new ways to do in every attempt.
Let&#8217;s not rest at expelling the traveler kids&#8212;hell,
we&#8217;re <em>all </em>expelled, time-tested CrimethInc.
agents first and foremost! Even the most experienced of
us insurrectionists must start from scratch every morning
to foment insurrection, shaking off the inertia of the past
to see anew what the current context calls for. When we
succeed in doing this, we can change the world, for it is
inertia above all that keeps the wheels spinning as they
do. If we cannot, we are done for&#8212;we will be more
anachronists than anarchists, and our activism mere retroactivism.</p><p>
And so now we turn away from the past, from all explanations
and justifications and apologies, to face the future and
the experiments we have in store for it. Doubtless, they
will occasion comparable storms of controversy and misconception,
if we are ambitious enough to keep pushing our own limits
and hazarding schemes crazy enough to work. So, all would-be
crimethinkers are hereby expelled from CrimethInc.&#8212;whoever
can discover the strategies for the next offensive, set
the terms for the next infectious revolts and heated debates
and social upheavals, let them claim it for themselves!
Expect our next book, or one of them, to be a liberation
manual for middle-aged mothers, not another youth&#8217;s
chronicle of wilful indigence. In the meantime, let&#8217;s
us traveler kids stop congratulating ourselves on how free
we are and start using that word, <em>free</em>, as a verb,
not an adjective. </p>
