<h1>The Unabomber:</h1>
<h2 style="margin-top: 0px">&nbsp;A Hero For Our Time</h2>
<p> Pop quiz: what is it called when one of the finest
minds of a generation picks a few individuals who are personally involved
in the destruction of the environment (a timber-industry lobbyist) or
of the attention span and reasoning ability of tens of thousands of Americans
(an advertising executive), and kills or maims them in the pursuit of
finding a voice for his concerns about social issues . . . concerns that
otherwise would be heard by very few? Clearly, it is murder.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> And what is it called when a nation of overweight
barbers and underpaid clerks, of lazy unemployed middle class intellectuals
and talk-show-educated housewives, of cowardly fast-food-chin managers
and racist sorority girls, conspires to execute this murderer in the name
of protecting the glorious status quo from his obviously deranged "mad
bombings"? </p>
<p> The death penalty. And rightly applied, too, in
defense of the right of forest clear-cutters and professional liars to
continue bending our world to their vision without the danger of being
molested by those who prefer redwood forests to Quik-Marts and sonnets
to detergent slogans. </p>
<p> Seriously, and rhetoric aside, what is the difference
between the two situations? In one case, a single person evaluates his
situation and decides upon a course of action he feels is right. In the
other case, millions of people, who are not very used to making up their
minds by themselves, feel strong enough all together to strike out blindly
against an individual who does not remain within their boundaries of acceptable
behavior. </p>
<p> Now, our gentle and moderate reader would no doubt
like to object that it is not fear of the free-standing individual that
prompts the outcry against this terrorist, but moral indignation&#151;for he
has taken "innocent" life in his quest to have his ideas heard, and that
is wrong in every situation. </p>
<p> But this nation of petty imbeciles is not regularly
outraged about the taking of innocent life: as long as it fits within
the parameters of the status quo, they don't care at all. </p>
<p> How many more people than the Unabomber have tobacco
companies maimed and killed, by using advertising to addict them at a
very young and uninformed age to an extremely harmful drug? How about
the companies that advertise and sell cheap liquor in impoverished neighborhoods
filled with alcoholics? How many citizens of third world nations have
suffered and died at the hands of governments supported by such corporations
as Pepsi Co., or even by the U.S. government itself? And how much animal
life is destroyed thoughtlessly every year, every day in death camp factory
farms... or in ecological destruction brought about by such companies
as Exxon (our reader will remember the Valdez) or McDonalds (one of the
better known destroyers of the rainforest)? No one is particularly concerned
about these abuses of "innocent" life. </p>
<p> And indeed, it is harder to be, for they are institutionalized
within the social and economic system... "normal." Besides, it is hard
to figure out who exactly is responsible for them, for they are the results
of the workings of complicated bureaucracies. </p>
<p> On the other hand, when one individual attempts
to make his criticism of these destructive systems heard by the only really
effective means, it is easy to pick him out and string him up. And our
hypocritical outrage about his wrongdoings compared those of our own social
institutions shows that it is his ability to act upon his own conclusions
that truly shocks and frightens us most of all. </p>
<p> Our fear of the Unabomber as a freely acting individual
shows in the attempts our media has made to demonize him. Details of his
life, such as his academic achievements and his ability to live a Thoreauan
self-sufficient existence, that would normally occasion praise, are now
used to demonstrate that he is a maladjusted freak. Random and unimportant
details of his life, similar to details of any of our lives, such as failed
love affairs and childhood illnesses, are used to explain his "insane
behavior." In speaking thus, the press suggests that there is no question
at all that his actions were the result of insanity, pulling away in terror
from the very thought that he might be just as rational as they. Newspapers
print the most arbitrary and disconnected excerpts of his manifesto that
they can combine, and they describe the manifesto as being random and
disconnected&#151;they even describe it as "ramblings" with a straight face,
despite the well-known short attention span of today's media. </p>
<p> But it is not necessary that we accept the media's
typical over-simplification of the case. The Unabomber's manifesto has,
as a result of his efforts, been published and widely distributed. We
can all read it for ourselves, not just in disconnected excerpts, but
in its entirety, and decide for ourselves what we think of his ideas.
</p>
<p> Do not be frightened by the Unabomber's willingness
to stand out from the crowds and take whatever actions he believes are
necessary to achieve his goals. In a civilization so stricken with mindless
submission to social norms and irrational rules his example should be
refreshing rather than horrifying; for his worst crimes are no worse than
ours, in being citizens of this nation... and his greatest deeds as a
dedicated and intelligent individual far outshine those of most of our
heroes, who are for the most part basketball players and cookie-cutter
pop musicians anyway. </p>
<p> At least, given the chance as we are, we should
read his manifesto and come to our own conclusions, rather than allowing
the press and popular opinion/paranoia to decide for us. </p>
