<h1>Forget Terrorism</h1>
<h2 style="margin-top: 0px">The Hijacking of Reality</h2>
<p><em>A
person who has a sense that her life is meaningful and her
destiny is in her hands is in fundamental ways more alive
than a person who does not. In that sense, on September
11, terrorists used airplanes to kill thousands of people,
and politicians and media used the event to kill a little
bit of everyone who survived.</em></p>
<p>
Here&#8217;s one of those rare stories that gets the same
spin from both the corporate and the independent media:
there was a brief window of time between November 1999 and
September 2001 when the most fundamental conflict in theworld
was between power and people. Up until the Berlin wall fell
<a class="footnote" href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return overlib('History is rife with ironic coincidences, not the least of which being that the Berlin wall fell on 11/9.', CAPTION, '[1]');" onmouseout="nd();">[1]</a>,
it had been between capitalism and communism; now, as everyone
knows, it&#8217;s between terrorism and so-called democracy.
But for that brief, exhilarating period, the primary dichotomy
in more and more people&#8217;s minds was between hierarchy
and domination on the one hand and autonomy, liberty, and
cooperation on the other.</p>
<p>
Everywhere across the planet, people were starting to organize
themselves, testing their hands at self-directed activities
and pushing back when state and corporate interests tried
to interfere. As summits of the economic elite were shut
down, local collectives assembled, and global networks of
resistance linked up, it began to feel like the future was
up for grabs. But no one on either side of the barricades
had factored in the unsettled accounts U.S. foreign policy
had wrought in the third world, and everything changed the
day terrorists, directed by a former employee of the C.I.A.,
brought those chickens home to roost in New York City.</p>
<p>
Everyone knows the unutterable tragedy that occurred that
morning, when thousands of human beings lost their lives
in an act of cold-blooded violence. But another tragedy,
a stranger, subtler one, compounded the first: the tragedy
that occurs in this society when a large number of people
have the misfortune of losing their lives live on international
television.</p>
<p>
An interesting side effect of the events of September 11
was that television news ratings shot through the roof.
<em>Everyone</em> was glued to the television: and all conversations,
in every city, state, and nation, were about New York City.
Suddenly&#8212;because what one thinks about is one&#8217;s
reality&#8212;New York City, and more specifically the attack
and deaths, were the <em>epicenter</em> of reality, and
the zones radiating outward from it were less and less real.
The most a man in Iowa could hope for was to have a family
member in the towers, so he could be connected by blood
to the things that mattered. That, of course, is an insensitive
overstatement&#8212;but let&#8217;s not deny that some of
us who didn&#8217;t have such a relative felt a twinge of
secret, perhaps subconscious jealousy of those who did,
who could speak with such anguish and outrage about the
one and only subject on anyone&#8217;s mind.</p>
<p>
In the same way that serial killers and serial dramas, disaster
movies and real disasters command attention, so did New
York City: and everyone outside the city was paralyzed,
looking on from a distance, wondering what would happen
next as one does in a movie theater. We were all powerless,
our sense of agency gone at the most urgent of times. Those
of us who opposed corporate media and otherwise refused
to be complicit in our own passivity still stared at the
screen with everyone else; those who did not have such an
analysis watched and accepted the conclusions of the talking
heads as if they were their own. Later, doing as they were
told, they raised a flag that was not their own, either.</p>
<p>
So-called &#8220;activists&#8221; were among the ones <em>most</em>
paralyzed, comparatively speaking. Those who had shared
a sense that they could change the world now froze up as
if hypnotized. This was certainly convenient for the powers
that be, who scripted the coverage and spin of the tragedy&#8212;but
why did this happen?</p>
<p>
If you want to disable people, make them feel insignificant.
Feeling insignificant paralyzes; without morale and momentum,
all the power in the world&#8212;and remember, that power
is made up of the assembled powers of all individuals, it
is not some scepter wielded from above&#8212;can only be
applied accidentally, according to the dictates of the few
whose sense of entitlement is reinforced by their titles
and television exposure. Feelings of insignificance render
insignificant; desperation to be &#8220;where the action
is&#8221; replaces the ability to decide for oneself <em>what</em>
the action should be.</p>
<p>
The underlying message of the news, the implication hammered
deeper home with every replay of the towers collapsing,
was that whatever we little people did, world history, and
therefore real life, was out of our hands. The trivial little
games activists and communities had been playing were irrelevant;
no one would pay attention any longer, let alone join in.
This was not necessarily true, of course. But
it was news because it was on the news, and because it was
news it made itself true.<a class="footnote" href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return overlib('This shows how much we&#8217;ll have to learn about being able to ignore the media, if we are to build a sustainable liberation movement.', CAPTION, '[2]');" onmouseout="nd();">[2]</a></p>
<p>
Ironically, this displacement of meaning&#8212;this centering
of attention upon New York City as the global nucleus of
meaning itself&#8212;was exactly what had outraged and baited
the terrorists. But striking back at the heart of the empire
with the same violence they had learned from it, they simply
fed the beast&#8212;for whether you suffer it or apply it,
terrorism is the ultimate spectator sport, and spectatorship
can only consolidate power in the hands of the ones who
direct the spotlight.</p>
<p>
Those towers were not just a locus of financial power, but
even more so of iconographic power&#8212;the most valuable
currency in this information age. How is that kind of power
gathered and reproduced? In the same way financial capital
is gathered and reproduced: moguls centralize and monopolize
it by impoverishing others of the sense that their life
has meaning, thus forcing them to buy in to their mass-produced
meanings. For example: people in small town America watch
television instead of talking with each other, just as indigenous
peoples outside the U.S. seek sweatshop employment, because
it seems to be the only game town. This isn&#8217;t natural&#8212;for
the mass-manufactured alternatives to appear desirable,
those television watchers have to have lost the intimate
connections and ongoing projects that would have brought
them together off their couches, just as the natives have
to have had their traditional lifeways destroyed by conquistadors.
Disneyland is as fun as Des Moines is dull, just as Michael
Jordan is as rich as a Nike sweatshop worker is poor&#8212;these
are not coincidences. Economic exploitation and media domination
are essentially the same process, carried out on different
levels.</p>
<p>
So in terms of the war for sense of self that has gone on
between us and mass media for generations now, September
11th, 2001 saw an act of superlative terrorism carried out
against every one of us: not just in the hijacking and crashing
of the planes, but in the way the event was used to hijack
and crash the budding sense that we could determine reality
for ourselves. This consolidated power in the hands of the
U.S. government, among others, who used it to
further paralyze and distract people by starting a series
of controversial wars.<a class="footnote" href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return overlib('As Hitler said, if you want to keep soldiers from stopping to think for themselves, keep your armies marching&#8212;and that goes for liberal protesters as well as army recruits.', CAPTION, '[3]');" onmouseout="nd();">[3]</a>
In a time when the hierarchical elite was anxious to come
up with a new false dichotomy to distract everyone from
the fundamental struggle between power and people, nothing
could have been more opportune.</p>
<p>
The question, now&#8212;the ultimate question, on which
all life hinges&#8212;is how we can once more reframe the
terms of this conflict. It is not a question merely of peace
versus war: the decade of &#8220;peace&#8221; that led up
to the September 11 attacks was sufficiently bloody to persuade
a generation of suicide bombers that it was worth dying
to get revenge on the West, and a new peace under the current
conditions would be even more treacherous. Nor can we cast
this as a conflict between ideologies: we cannot afford
to be armchair quarterbacks any longer, backing our favored
teams or themes against others while bullets and bombs rain
randomly into the stands. The question is&#8212;always is,
no matter who is dying or killing, no matter what is said
on television&#8212;what we can do ourselves, what we make
of our lives, how each of us interacts with global events
in our daily decisions. Our opponents are those who would
hinder our efforts and obscure this question for their own
ends, who would rather rule over a world of passive spectators
wracked by terror and war than take a place among equals
acting to correct the injustices that provide justifications
for politicians and terrorists alike.</p>
<p>
Everyone knows, if it were up to us there would be no more
wars, no more exploitation, no more terrorism.<em> It is
up to us.</em></p>
