<h1>Reconsidering Television</h1>
<h5>a look behind the 'scenes':<br />
inside the mind of a serial
killer</h5>
<p> Everyone knows how insipid and inane most television programs are. It's
clear to anyone who spends an hour in front of prime time that the sitcoms,
news, and commercials alike are deliberately designed to appeal to lowest
common denominator levels of taste, intelligence, and attention span in
the intended viewers. It has been a clich for generations now that television
is "mindless entertainment." However, most people don't really see this
as any objection to watching television. It's not too hard to come to
associate inanity and irrelevance with entertainment, to come to assume
that "being entertained" means giving your critical and creative faculties
a rest—how tiresome it is to be critical and creative, anyway! And in
a society that seems intent on taking nothing seriously outside of the
"professional world" of production, exchange of goods and services, and
accumulation of wealth (witness our general disinterest in everything
from Dante to date rape), it seems only natural that we spend our leisure
time in the least constructive manner possible. </p>
<p>But the negative effects of watching too much television are much more
complicated than they appear to be at first glance. </p>
<p> Our dependence upon television and other manifestations of the homogenized
"mass media" to keep us entertained and (such as it is!) informed has
economic, social, and, most importantly, personal ramifications for all
of us. For our relationship with this media is one of spectator to spectacle,
and life itself is less fulfilling for those who watch than it is for
those who act. </p>
<p>This spectator/spectacle relationship is revealed by the godlike status
of "stars" and other public figures in our society. The media depend partly
upon the glamorization, even deification, of "personalities" such as Tom
Cruise, Ice Cube or Nancy Reagan for the material they collectively use
to keep us watching. Certainly these people are not that much different
from or more exciting than the rest of us—and the fact that so many of
them can move from one role to another (from model to rock star, from
rock star to actor, from actor to president of the United States) without
anyone batting an eye is proof that it is their mere status as public
figures, not their unusual talents in a given field, that make them "newsworthy."
So much useless information about these individuals is spewed at us daily
that one can't help but eventually pay attention... soon you know more
about Madonna's new boyfriend than you know about your own neighbors.
Perhaps you even begin to live vicariously through Madonna, as the media
presents her as the personification of "feminine" charm and danger, as
living a life vastly more interesting than your own. </p>
<p> Even worse, we soon know even more about fictional characters than we
do about real people. Listen to people in their casual conversation and
you'll hear how much time they waste talking about television shows, old
movies, and comic book characters. When we could be making better plans
for our own lives or getting to know each other better, we instead spend
our time exchanging useless information the media has pumped into our
heads. And of course the more time we spend wondering who will be Rolling
Stone's "band of the year" next, the less time we have to make more of
our own lives. </p>
<h3>There's a reason that things are this way.</h3>
<p>When television companies, movie producers, and their ilk convince us
that entertaining, exciting life is not something that exists all around
us every day but instead can only be found in the lives of celebrities,
or in movies, they get to sell life itself back to us. </p>
<p>That is, when you spend your spare time watching television rather than
traveling or falling in love or playing soccer, you come to believe that
the most excitement you can have is in watching a travel show, a soap
opera, or a sports game on television. And the more you watch these things
on television, the more you forget that you could actually be out doing
these things yourself rather than just watching them. You'd be surprised
how much more exciting it is to actually make music yourself than to watch
MTV—how much more fulfilling it is to make love yourself than to watch
some strangers in a pornographic movie—how much more exhilarating it
is to actually struggle against an obstacle yourself than to just watch
an adventure movie. But the less often you leave the television set to
actually do these things, the more empty your actual life is, and the
more you need the television shows to make up for the lack of any real
excitement in your life. </p>
<p> And that's where the media moguls come in. They're happy to provide
you with a substitute life—at a price. Sure they'll sell you second-rate
sex and violence, vicarious excitement and affection... but you have to
pay for it on pay-per-view or cable television, you have to pay to buy
the television sets and the movie tickets and the computer modems, you
have to buy the latest fashion or music magazine. Above all you have to
listen to their commercials on the radio, read them in the magazines,
or watch them in between television shows. These commercials are carefully
engineered to get you to spend your money on the products being advertised...
and when you do spend your money on them, you'll need to work harder and
longer at your job to make more money. In fact chances are that your job
isn't too rewarding to you either, and rather than making you feel so
alive that you don't need television anymore your job probably makes watching
television seem thrilling by comparison. Similarly, you may feel so exhausted
when you finish work for the day that you don't have the energy to do
anything but turn on the television... and you may even come to associate
doing things with working, and thus with being exhausted and dissatisfied,
and watching things with being "off the clock" and feeling "free." So
you find yourself seeking meaning in life from watching the Superbowl
rather than working on your own game. </p>
<p>And this would be hilarious if it wasn't so tragic: as likely than not,
the job you put all your effort into has something to do with the media
or marketing industry. Maybe you work at an advertising agency, or a television
station, or for some business that makes and markets a product that is
completely useless to humanity—but that everyone buys because it is so
heavily advertised. Coca Cola is a good example. So while you're getting
burned out and missing out on real life, on visceral, intense, unmediated
experience, just so you can buy a cheap substitute for it, you're supporting
the same system that is wasting your time until you die. And make no mistake
about it, you are going to die—do you want to look back on a life of
watching and talking about the Cosby Show, or a life of pain and pleasure,
romance and struggle, love and hate? </p>
<p>Are you satisfied to watch other people do what you could be doing yourself,
if you didn't waste so much time watching, didn't spend so much time working
at a job you hate to buy things you don't need... to pay for more watching?
</p>
<p>The solution is simple, if you want it: it's easy to turn off your television
set and go outside. Stop caring what Elvis' daughter is doing, and start
caring what your friends or enemies are doing, what your lover or stepmother
is doing. Walk out of your office cell-block into the sunshine and learn
to do without those fancy clothes or brand new stereo so that you will
be free to live a life of challenge and excitement, a life filled with
new experiences—a life where you are the master of your own fate rather
than just a victim of a dull job and a few sharp advertising campaigns.
Surely if you used all that energy that you waste selling shoes or programming
computers for your employer, you could find a rewarding way to earn enough
money yourself to more than survive. . . or, better yet, you could work
with others towards a world in which survival does not depend upon money.
</p>
<p>Act now or forever hold your peace; don't talk about how bored you are,
or how much you hate your job, or how amazingly meaningless your life
seems (when and if you ever actually stop to think clearly about it) if
you're not willing to try to set yourself free. </p>
