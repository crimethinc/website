<h1>Alive In The Land Of The Dead</h1>
<p>
The 20th Century has marked the end of the millennium that saw the
world become colonized by and organized under Western civilization,
that saw the industrial revolution and overpopulation restructure
both humanity and the very surface of the earth itself. This century
began with fifty years of alternating slaughter, starvation, and rabid
nationalism such as the human race had never seen before. It is concluding
with an ominous silence among young people in the United States and
much of Europe, for with the end of the "Cold War" the idea that there
really is any alternative at all to our modern living conditions and
society is becoming hard to conceive of; and in the meantime, we are
becoming more and more organized and arranged by the technological
systems that we set up with the supposed intentions of making our
lives more free and meaningful. </p>
<p> As this century is ending with sentimental retrospectives and the
like, what we really must do is not look back but look ahead. Now more
than ever we must consider whether our modern lives as we have come
to live them over the last thousand years really satisfy all our needs
and desires as human beings, and prepare for the new millennium to be
a new chapter in the human experiment. We must use the lessons we have
learned from the 20th Century to plan for a new era in which human life
can be meaningful and fulfilling, even thrilling, heroic. Or have we
learned any lessons? </p>
<p> Don't wait for permission, for some far-off "world revolution," for
later "when you have more time." Demand joy, danger, passion in your
life today! </p>
<h3>About the Problem</h3>
<p> The poverty against which man has been struggling throughout history
is not merely the poverty of material goods; the ennui and disorientation
experienced by the members of the middle and upper classes in today's
wealthy industrial nations have revealed the poverty of Western existench
itself. </p>
<p> The problems that we face today cannot be traced to class conflict
alone. It is not merely a question of the ruling class profiting at
the expense of the proletariat, for we have seen that the profit that
those with capital do make does not make their lives any more fulfilling.
It does not matter whether a woman is buried alive in a prison, in a
reform school, in a sweatshop, in a ghetto, in a prestigious university,
in a condominium bought on credit, or in a mansion with a private swimming
pool and tennis courts, so long as she is buried alive. Everyone suffers
from today's status quo, albeit differently; but whether a man is starving
on his minimum wage salary, exhausted by his repetitive responsibilities
at the office, or befuddled by the curious feeling of emptiness that
accompanies the undirected acquisition of material wealth, he has a
stake in fighting for change. So we all, rich and poor, must band together
to consider our situation and struggle to alter it. </p>
<p> This also means that there is no mythical "They." Innumerable radical
movements and social critics have relied upon this concept to motivate
people by stirring up hatred for the "evil orchestrators" of human suffering,
the enemies who conspire against us. But this kind of thinking only
serves to divide us against each other, and whether we are divided on
class lines, on color lines, or according to any other categories, we
are distracted from the important issues and impeded in our progress.
Our true "enemy" is the social forces and patterns at work between ourselves,
and it is these forces which we must come to understand and to struggle
against. </p>
<p> This is not to say that there are not individuals whose behavior is
particularly dangerous to their fellow human beings, insofar as it perpetuates
or intensifies our present state of emergency. But even if these individuals
do have negative intentions towards others, it is still unlikely that
they possess a clear understanding of the extremely complicated conditions
to which they are contributing. </p>
<h3>About the Process</h3>
<p> We individuals who are unsatisfied with their lives, who do feel the
"poverty" of the existench that modern Western civilization has to offer,
must seek out others who are experiencing similar symptoms. Together,
we must construct and publicize an analysis of our situation: a theory
of why human beings act and interact in the ways that they do today,
and how this leads to our sensations of alienation, disorientation,
and exhaustion. </p>
<p> This analysis must have effective action of some kind as its necessary
and immediate consequence, or else (as have the theories of a long tradition
of "radical" discussion groups) it will come to nothing. </p>
<p> And this struggle presupposes participants who are fighting for themselves,
to see and feel change and improvement in the course of their own lives&#151;as
we shall see&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<h3>About the Solution</h3>
<p> Whatever solution, whatever revolution, we propose, must be present-oriented
rather than future-oriented if it is to be genuinely revolutionary.
</p>
<p> The past and the present are both full of examples which indicate
this. To consider one: Christianity demands of its followers that they
delay gratification until they enter the next world, when they will
supposedly be rewarded for their proper conduct; in doing so it assumes
that this proper conduct is not fulfilling enough in itself to be worthwhile
unless it is rewarded. This kind of thinking reflects a dire misunderstanding
of the nature of human happiness; for happiness is to be found in activity,
in activities that are exciting and satisfying in and of themselves,
rather than in passively awaiting rewards for unsatisfying activities.
Therefore it is not surprising that many devout Christians are bitter,
spiteful individuals who jealously resent healthy activity and excitement
in others&#151;for they believe that they will find true happiness only
in their "heavenly reward" for behavior that is not at all exciting
for them, and thus must watch enviously as others freely do what they
can only dream of doing in their most "sinful" fantasies. Conversely,
many Christians who are happy are happy despite their Christianity,
because they are able to take pleasure in their lives and deeds in this
world. </p>
<p> Traditional Marxism takes the Christian mistake one step further by
asking its adherents to work towards a revolution they will probably
never live to see&#151;that is, in the Marxist "faith," gratification is
delayed beyond the reach of human experience. It should be no surprise
that today, beyond a little anachronistic romanticism about the "nobility"
of self-sacrifice, the Marxist offer serves as little incentive for
people to seriously fight for the "communist revolution." In contrast,
today's capitalistic consumer market at least promises prompt gratification
in the form of material goods (and the myths and images it associates
with them) in return for the generally unsatisfying labor it requires.
But&#151;does it deliver true gratification to its participants? </p>
<p> Again, happiness is an active experience, not a passive sensation.
Thus, a woman who cooks a recipe of her own invention for her friends
may find a great deal of pleasure and meaning in this undertaking, while
a man who slaves all day to cook exotic food in an expensive restaurant
will find that the purchases he makes with his paycheck cannot compensate
him for the days of his life he has given up. You can purchase a twenty
acre estate, the latest in status-symbol automobiles, and an entire
wardrobe of unique and exquisite fashions, but the pleasure that these
possessions afford cannot compare to the exhilaration of spending a
day freely pursuing your desires. </p>
<p> Accordingly, our revolution must be an immediate revolution in our
daily lives; anything else is not a revolution but a demand that once
again people do what they do not want to do and hope that this time,
somehow, the compensation will be enough. Those who assume, often unconsciously,
that it is impossible to achieve their own desires&#151;and thus, that it
is futile to fight for themselves&#151;often end up fighting for an ideal
or cause instead. But it is still possible to fight for ourselves, or
at least the experiment must be worth a try; so it is crucial that we
seek change not in the name of some doctrine or grand cause, but on
behalf of ourselves, so that we will be able to live more meaningful
lives. Similarly we must seek first and foremost to alter the contents
of our own lives in a revolutionary manner, rather than direct our struggle
towards world-historical changes which we will not live to witness.
In this way we will avoid the feelings of worthlessness and alienation
that result from believing that it is necessary to "sacrifice oneself
for the cause," and instead live to experience the fruits of our labors.
. . in our labors themselves. </p>
<p> To put it another way, our revolution must be above all a revolution
in the ways we live and think. It must be a recognition and rejection
of the thought patterns and patterns of social interaction that have
led us to today's unsatisfying existench, in favor of patterns of thought
and interaction that will be satisfying in themselves. It must be a
revolution in our motivations, replacing reward-motivated behavior with
behavior that is intrinsically meaningful. It must be a revolution in
our everyday lives. Rejecting boredom, exhaustion, and despair for excitement,
danger, love, passion and compassion&#151;that is a revolution worth fighting
for! And certainly there are large scale, long term goals that we must
fight for, to make this revolution possible for all of us in the years
to come; but we should fight for these goals not out of servitude to
a doctrine or cause, but because it is exciting and invigorating today
to strive for difficult and worthy objectives. </p>
<p> Alive in the land of the dead. They eat dead food with false teeth.
Their buildings have false fronts, their radio and television stations
broadcast dead air. They kill time as spectators of false images. Their
corporations are guilty of false advertising, and their employment 'opportunities'
offer only murderous mistreatment, lethal boredom, and fatal submission;
they demand that you meet deadlines, that you pitch tent in the death
camps. Does the dead end justify the means? They inhabit dead cities
and make false moves, really going nowhere at all, treading day after
day the same path of despair. Even their air is conditioned. They ask
you to give your lives for their countries, for their religions, for
their economies, leaving you with only. . . . Their system is organized
by artificial intelligence and provides only virtual reality. Their
culture will pin you down and bore you to death, their lifestyle is
lifeless, their existench is a permanent deadlock. Everything about
them is dead and false. The only thing that is unbearable is that nothing
is unbearable. When will we demand more? </p>
<h5>The struggle is for life, for real life. Fight
foul, life is real!</h5>
<h6><strong>Footnote:</strong> The word "revolution" may be amusing or off-putting to the
modern reader, convinced as he is that effective resistance to the status
quo is impossible and therefore not even worth considering. Gentle reader,
we ask that you suspend your disbelief long enough to at least contemplate
whether or not such a thing might be worthwhile if it were possible;
and then that you suspend it further, long enough to recognize this
disbelief for what it is&#151;despair!</h6>
