<h3>I. Normalcy</h3>
<p> People from the (rapidly splintering) "mainstream" of society in Europe
and the United States today take a peculiar pleasure in considering themselves
"normal" in comparison to legal offenders, political radicals, and other
members of social outgroups. They treat this "normalcy" as if it is an
indication of mental health and moral righteousness, regarding the "others"
with a mixture of pity and disgust. But if we consult history, we can
see that the conditions and patterns of human life have changed so much
in the past two centuries that it is impossible to speak of any lifestyle
available to human beings today as being "normal" in the natural sense,
as being a lifestyle for which we adapted over many generations. Of the
lifestyles from which a young woman growing up in the West today can choose,
none are anything like the ones for which her ancestors were prepared
by centuries of natural selection and evolution. </p>
<p> It is more likely that the "normalcy" that these people hold so dear
is rather the feelings of normalcy that result from conformity to a standard.
Being surrounded by others who behave the same way, who are conditioned
to the same routines and expectations, is comforting because it reinforces
the idea that one is pursuing the right course: if a great many people
make the same decisions and live according to the same customs, then these
decisions and customs must be the right ones. </p>
<p> But the mere fact that a number of people live and act in a certain
way does not make it any more likely that this way of living is the one
that will bring them the most happiness. Besides, the lifestyles associated
with the American and European "mainstream" (if such a thing truly exists)
were not exactly consciously chosen as the best possible ones by those
who pursue them; rather, they came to be suddenly, as the results of technological
and cultural upheavals. Once the peoples of Europe, the United States,
and the world realize that there is nothing necessarily "normal" about
their "normal life," they can begin to ask themselves the first and most
important question of the next century: Are there ways of thinking, acting,
and living that might be more satisfying and exciting than the ways we
think, act, and live today? </p>
<h3>II. Transformation</h3>
<p> If the accumulated knowledge of Western civilization has anything of
value to offer us at this point, it is an awareness of just how much is
possible when it comes to human life. Our otherwise foolish scholars of
history and sociology and anthropology can at least show us this one thing:
that human beings have lived in a thousand different kinds of societies,
with ten thousand different tables of values, ten thousand different relationships
to each other and the world around them, ten thousand different conceptions
of self. A little traveling can still show you the same thing, if you
get there before Coca-Cola has had too much of a head start. </p>
<p> That's why I can't help but scoff when someone refers to "human nature,"
invariably in the course of excusing himself for a miserable resignation
to our supposed fate. Don't you realize we share a common ancestor with
sea urchins? If differing environments can make these distant cousins
of ours so very distant from us, how much more possible must small changes
in ourselves and our interactions be! If there is anything lacking (and
there sorely, sorely is, most will admit) in our lives, anything unnecessarily
tragic or meaningless in them, any corner of happiness that we have not
yet thoroughly explored, then all that is needed is for us to alter our
environments accordingly. "If you want to change the world, you first
must change yourself," the saying goes; we have learned that the opposite
is true. </p>
<p> And there is another valuable discovery our species has made, albeit
the hard way: we are capable of absolutely transforming environments.
The place you lie, sit, or stand reading this was probably altogether
different a hundred years ago, not to mention two thousand years ago;
and almost all of those changes were brought about by human beings. We
have completely remade our world in the past few centuries, changing life
for almost every kind of plant and animal, ourselves most of all. It only
remains for us to experiment with executing (or, for that matter, not
executing) these changes intentionally, in accordance with our needs and
desires, rather than at the mercy of irrational, inhuman forces like competition,
superstition, routine. </p>
<p> Once we realize this, we can claim a new destiny for ourselves, both
individually and collectively. No longer will we be buffeted about by
powers that seem beyond our control; instead, in this exploration of ourselves
through the creation of new environments, we will learn all that we can
be. This path will take us out of the world as we know it, far beyond
the farthest horizons we can see from here. We will become artists of
the grandest kind, painting with desire as a medium, deliberately creating
and recreating ourselves&mdash;becoming, ourselves, our own greatest work. </p>
<p>To accomplish this, we'll need to learn how to coexist and collaborate
successfully: to see just how interconnected all our lives are, and finally
learn to live with that in mind. Until this becomes possible, each of
us will not only be denied the vast potential of her fellows, but her
own potential as well; for we all make together the world that each of
us must live in and be made by. The other thing that is lacking is the
knowledge of our own desires. Desire is a slippery thing, amoebic and
difficult to pin down, let alone keep up with. If we're going to make
a destiny out of the pursuit and transformation of desire, we first must
find ways to discover and release our loves and lusts. For this, not enough
experience and adventure could ever suffice. So the makers of this new
world must be more generous and more greedy than any who have come before:
more generous with each other, and more greedy for life! </p>
<h3>III. Utopia</h3>
<p> Even from here, I can taste the question already on the tip of your
tongue: isn't this utopian? </p>
<p> Well, of course it is. You know what everyone's greatest fear is? It
is that all the dreams we have, all the crazy ideas and aspirations, all
the impossible romantic longings and utopian visions can come true, that
the world can grant our wishes. People spend their lives doing everything
in their power to fend off that possibility: they beat themselves up with
every kind of insecurity, sabotage their own efforts, undermine love affairs
and cry sour grapes before the world even has a chance to defeat them...
because no weight could be heavier to bear than the possibility that everything
we want is possible. If that is true, then there really are things at
stake in this life, things to be truly won or lost. Nothing could be more
heartbreaking than to fail when such success is actually possible, so
we do everything we can to avoid trying in the first place, to avoid having
to try. </p>
<p> For if there is even the slightest possibility that our hearts' desires
could be realized, then of course the only thing that makes sense is to
throw ourselves entirely into their pursuit and risk that heartbreak.
Despair and nihilism seem safer, projecting our hopelessness onto the
cosmos as an excuse for not even trying. So we remain, clutching our resignation,
as secure as corpses in coffins ("better safe and sorry")... but this
still cannot ward off that dreadful possibility. Thus in our hopeless
flight from the real tragedy of the world, we only heap upon ourselves
false tragedy, unnecessary tragedy, as well. </p>
<p> Perhaps this world will never conform perfectly to our needs&mdash;people
will always die before they are ready, perfect relationships will end
in ruins, adventures will end in catastrophe and beautiful moments be
forgotten. But what breaks my heart is the way we flee from those inevitable
truths into the arms of more horrible things. It may be true that every
man is lost in a universe that is fundamentally indifferent to him, locked
forever in a terrifying solitude&#151;but it doesn't have to be true that some
people starve while others destroy food or leave fertile farms untilled.
It doesn't have to be true that men and women waste their lives away working
to serve the hollow greed of a few rich men, just to survive. It doesn't
have to be that we never dare to tell each other what we really want,
to share ourselves honestly, to use our talents and capabilities to make
life more bearable, let alone more beautiful. That's unnecessary tragedy,
stupid tragedy, pathetic and pointless. It's not even utopian to demand
that we put an end to farces like these. </p>
<p> If we could bring ourselves to believe, to really feel, the possibility
that we are invincible and can accomplish whatever we want in this world,
it wouldn't seem out of our reach at all to correct such absurdities.
What I am begging you to do here is not to put faith in the impossible,
but have the courage to face that terrible possibility that our lives
really are in our own hands, and to act accordingly: to not settle for
every misery fate and humanity have heaped upon us, but to push back,
to see which ones can be shaken off. Nothing could be more tragic, and
more ridiculous, than to live out a whole life in reach of heaven without
ever stretching out your arms. </p>
