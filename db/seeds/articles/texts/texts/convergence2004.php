<h1>One Person&#8217;s Account of the
<br />
2004 CrimethInc. Convergence <br />
in Des Moines</h1>

<p>
We
spent months organizing and fundraising. Everything we did
leading up to the gathering seemed to fall right into place.
A week before the convergence was to start, two kids showed
up early to help out and explore the city. They turned out
to be amazing individuals with whom I hope to work again
soon. We spent the following week gathering food items and
other miscellaneous necessaries. Groups and individuals
started to show up as early as Wednesday. Everyone helped
out around the house where we were staying, which I found
quite refreshing. By night, we traded tales of our adventures
traveling to Des Moines, and plotted new ones for the days
that would follow. This was especially interesting because
unlike similar convergences, people were showing up with
completely different agendas. Some were here simply to engage
in conversation, others to form affinity groups for the
protests at the upcoming Republican National Convention,
a few simply for a free ride to NYC, but most because they
wanted change in their daily lives.</p>
<p>Friday
night came quickly, and as the convergence officially began,
things were off to a good start. Everyone traveled out to
the camp site, and we had already started planning for the
next few days. I was unable to attend the first few hours,
due to circumstances out of my control, but Friday night
seemed to go well; we prepared for the massive Food Not
Bombs we had planned for the next day, at which skill shares
and workshops would ensue in the middle of downtown Des
Moines.</p>
<p>Saturday
began with Food Not Bombs at noon. It went well, as we fed
more homeless people that day than any other in recent memory.
Afterwards, people split up into small groups to dumpster
and gather food for the night. I got out to the campsite
at around 10:00 pm, and was informed that the police had
arrested at least one person in Des Moines on account of
an allegedly broken Radio Shack window and supposed possession
of a slingshot. Because the individual was a minor, he was
put in Juvenile Hall, which made it very difficult for us
to obtain information on his situation. This development
was unfortunate news, because it offered a set up for constant
police and FBI harassment and intimidation for the duration
of the convergence.</p>
<p>We
didn&#8217;t let this affect our plans, however. We continued
our efforts, doing everything we could to get our friend
out of jail and to maintain morale and motivation in our
numbers. We held a security culture workshop later that
night, and everyone agreed to be very cautious when doing
anything that would give the authorities any more opportunity
than they already had to disrupt our activities. Of course,
our being anarchists was itself sufficient to bring upon
us all the scrutiny and repression they could muster. The
intimidation tactics the authorities used the next few days
were straight of the textbook: they threatened us with evictions,
conspiracy charges, arrests, and so on. However, a few individuals
didn&#8217;t take the situation seriously, and were arrested
the following day, Monday, for stealing books at a Barnes
&amp; Noble. It seemed at this point that they were just
picking us off one by one, and were clearly hoping to prevent
all of us from going to the Republican National Convention.
Materials that were to be used in workshops and skillshares
mysteriously disappeared from our campsite, including lamp
oil that was to be used for a fire-breathing skillshare
and PVC pipe that was to be used in a home-made didgeridoo
workshop. The pigs then issued a statement saying they had
&#8220;evidence&#8221; that we were planning to make bombs
and carry out attacks at the RNC. At that point, an article
for which a friend of mine had been interviewed a week earlier
came out in the press, preparing the public for such ridiculous
accusations and calling them &#8220;typical police tactics
that have been used to demonize anarchists and activists
alike for well over 100 years.&#8221; This proved to be
helpful, as we gained public support from many local activist
groups.</p>
<p>Tuesday
night, we held a screening of the film The Fourth World
War at a local venue, and there was a surprising turnout,
raising over $200.</p>
<p>Wednesday
some people who had affinity groups waiting for them in
New York City left early for the demonstrations. That night,
another member of our group was arrested on &#8220;5th degree
theft charges,&#8221; on account of an American flag supposedly
stolen from a local resident near the campsite&#8212;although
the police would never release the person&#8217;s name or
give any evidence that the person even existed. My friend,
the arrestee, just so happened to have a piece of an American
Flag around his injured ankle.</p>
<p>Thursday,
everyone left safely as planned for the Republican National
Convention, in a group about ten people strong. I stayed
in town an extra day waiting for my friend to be released
from jail, and on Friday we were on our thirty-hour greyhound
bus ride to New York.</p>
<p> Although some of the activities we had planned were effectively
disrupted, I still believe that this was a good experience
for everyone. The most important thing to remember, in my
opinion, is that as we want to be taken seriously, we have
to expect to be taken seriously by the authorities. This
harassment came as no surprise to me, and shouldn&#8217;t
have to anyone else either. We were obviously doing something
effective, and frightened them enough to take the actions
they did. We just need to learn to be strong, and do as
much as we can to prepare, and fight back against anything
they dish out.</p>
