<h1>Divided and Conquered</h1>
<p>Over a century ago, a famous writer quipped that the industrial worker
was "a mere appendage of flesh on a machine of iron." Today, that description
can be applied across the board: each of us is no more than an appendage
of flesh on the vast machine that is our society, for our lives and communities
are atomized into isolated sectors. If we want to change the whole of
life, we must first become whole again. </p>
<h3>Separation: the Disintegration of the Self</h3>
<p>Modern man's activity is compartmentalized: it is divided and subdivided
into separate components which can only interfere with each other. He
experiences life as an ongoing conflict between achievement, romance,
social responsibility, fitness, relaxation, adventure, and so on, because
all these pursuits seem to be mutually exclusive. He would like to spend
more time with his wife, but if he doesn't stay at the office another
hour he won't be able to advance his career, and then he has to go to
the gym to firm up his belly and ward off poor health. . . and there's
that damn vacation at the beach to plan for, and world news to catch up
on, before he even gets to think about being romantic with her. Perhaps
he buys that Mozart CD that the advertisements said would relieve stress
and help focus his concentration skills&#151;hoping some new medication will
serve to fend off the symptoms of a life in which he never does anything
for its own sake! Perhaps he would like to get involved with some sort
of volunteer social work, but doesn't know where he would fit it into
his schedule; he has a hard enough time just taking the time out to watch
his favorite sitcom, and even that doesn't provide him with much relief
from his busy life. <i>Meaning</i>, of course, is absent everywhere when
life is disjointed; without unity of self in his pursuits, the modern
man can find no lasting satisfaction in any one of them. </p>
<p>Compare this with the integrated, holistic life of the "savage" or young
adventurer. For her, there is no distinction between working and playing,
between spending time with her friends and lovers, taking care of her
practical needs, and seeking pleasure. She moves through the world, finding
sustenance and getting exercise from the same activities, using her creativity
with her friends to weave a daily life that is both challenging and familiar,
at once adventure, livelihood, and religious ceremony. </p>
<p>Perhaps you've experienced this kind of lifestyle before, when you were
doing something that incorporated every aspect of your being into a perfect
equilibrium. We all need to find ways to integrate our lives, so that
we will not always be trying to make impossible choices between equally
necessary pieces of ourselves. . . and if we want to make this world a
better place, we have to find ways of living that are revolutionary in
their very nature; for politics, activism, or social responsibility as
a separate domain of life, as a hobby or part-time operation, can never
outweigh the effects of the rest of life. </p>
<h4>Example:</h4>
<p>My friend Mark practices Yoga to focus and relax himself. He is also an
artist and musician, who often travels around the country with his work.
Mark realized one day that when he neglects his exercises on the road,
he still feels focused and relaxed in ways that he simply couldn't at
home without Yoga. He concluded that the voyage itself must be a kind
of Yoga, perhaps the same kind of Yoga referred to by Ken Kesey in his
eulogy for Neil Cassady: </i></p>
<i>
<p> "His life was the yoga of a man driven to the cliff-edge by the grassfire
of an entire nation's burning material madness. Rather than be consumed
by this he jumped, choosing to sort things out in the fast-flying but
smog-free moments of a life with no retreat. In this commitment he placed
himself irrevocably beyond category." </p>

<h3>Specialization: the Sub-Division of Labor</h3>
<p>Just as our individual lives are fragmented by compartmentalization,
our society is fragmented by ever-increasing specialization. Every sphere
of life is relegated to the care of an elite core of specialists, who
administer it without consulting the rest of us. Every profession is divided
and subdivided: from scientist to chemist, from chemist to biochemist,
from biochemist to pharmaceutical neurobiologist until no one outside
a handful of experts can understand what is going on. At that point, the
division of knowledge itself becomes authoritarian, for it grants small
groups of people vast powers over others who cannot even fathom what those
powers are. </p>
<p>Becoming a specialist is a self-selecting process: only those willing
to concentrate on learning one subject to the exclusion of all else can
excel at it. Thus the engineers and computer programmers with the greatest
skills are willing to work for the government building weapons of mass
destruction and cracking the codes of "subversive" groups, for they have
never taken the time to reflect on what the effects of their efforts might
be. They simply do what they have been taught to do, for whoever provides
the chance to do it. </p>
<p>Each expert in this system of specialization is able to do his job well,
in a vacuum, but unable to see the larger whole. Without an analysis of
the part he plays in society, he sees it as an external force, acting
on him without his participation. And the people who form the various
parts of the machine are unable to relate to each other to take action
together when they want to change something about the world they are making,
separated as they are spatially and socially and psychologically into
their individual spheres; in fact, each tends to conceive of problems
in terms of its needs versus those of the other components of the machine:
the library would get the funding it needed if only it wasn't going to
the linguistics department, etc. </p>
<p>Specialization also discourages the rest of us from being well-rounded
and understanding the workings of our society. Painting is left up to
artists, the maintenance of our cars to automechanics, social change to
professional politicians or amateur activists. The more complicated technologies
become, and the more alienating the terminology used by those who work
with them, the fewer of us are able to exercise any control over our environments:
"Call the repair man," we chant, waiting in intimidated ignorance and
powerlessness. Similarly, all of us but the recognized "artists" miss
out on the joys of being creative in the aesthetic world. The true value
of a painting cannot be captured by purchasing it in a gallery and hanging
it on the wall; it lies in the moment when the painting is conceived,
when the artist is comparing sketches with her comrades late one night,
arguing about narrative and form, and has a sudden, exhilarating insight.
This is something we must all take part in, each with our unique talents.
The supposed divinity of artists, and the expert credentials of the art
critics who deify them, just like the genius of scientists and the arcane
knowledge of locksmiths, have fooled us into denying ourselves this irreplaceable
pleasure. </p>
<p>The role of the political activist as authority and expert paralyzes
the rest of humanity in correspondingly disastrous ways. Saddest and most
absurd of all is the way so many political activists unconsciously act
to alienate others, the very others with whom they hope in theory to find
common cause. Conditioned to believe that they need to be superior to
others to have value of their own, and believing in the scarcity economy
of self which demands that they stake out their identity in contrast to
the identities of those around them, today's insecure activists mistakenly
presume that they somehow benefit from showing off how much more knowledgeable,
more committed, and more ethical they are than everyone else. </p>
<p>Specialization <i>within</i> political circles is equally crippling.
Oblivious to each other's efforts and the strength they could wield as
an alliance, single-issue activists agitate about their chosen topics
in parallel ghettos; marginalized into a thousand individual campaigns,
they exhaust themselves trying to cure the symptoms of the dominant system,
rather than developing a resistance that could undermine the world order
that is ultimately responsible. </p>
<p>When being active is no longer an off-putting specialty, and partisans
of different struggles are able to find common cause, the world will finally
change. </p>
<h3>End Segregation! Integrate our lives!</h3>
<p>Somewhere across the world there is an underground circus or punk rock
band on tour as you read this. Unbeknownst to themselves and others, they
carry with them the seeds of a new and yet ancient social structure, which
could totally transform the ways all of us live and interact. Within the
group, responsibilities are shared and valued equally, and whenever someone
wants a break from doing something or is curious to learn about something
else, people switch roles. No one member's participation is less important
than anyone else's, whatever their individual strengths may be, for the
cooperation and contentment of each is crucial to the functioning of the
group. Each member's daily activities satisfy her various desires: she
feels at home with her friends while she travels through new environments,
she makes art that simultaneously entertains and educates others, she
gets exercise and learns new things repairing the van, she has adventures
collecting food and other supplies through an urban hunting and gathering
that does not conflict with her anti-consumerist ethics. Best of all,
she no longer has to distinguish between her own needs and those of the
people around her, which eliminates the greater part of the stress of
human interaction. Together all the participants function as an extended
family, and the positive atmosphere is so strong that over time they are
able to lose some members and gain others without losing any momentum.
</p>
<p>Yes, we'd have to downsize and restructure our whole civilization to
follow the lead this merry little band offers, but for the past few centuries
we've been struggling to deal with the difficulties of <i>not</i> living
in such communities&#151;and we haven't had much success. If we're going to
struggle anyway, it might as well be towards a utopia in which our lives
encompass can everything the cosmos has to offer. </p>
