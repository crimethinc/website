<h1>Beyond Democracy?</h1>
<h6><i>text courtesy of special agent Rolf Nadir</i></h6>
<p><i>Nowadays, "democracy" rules the world. Communism has fallen, elections
are happening more and more in those poor underdeveloped third world nations
you see on television, and world leaders are meeting to plan the "global
community" that we hear so much about. So why isn't everybody happy, finally?
For that matter&#151;why do less than half of the eligible voters in the United
States, the world's flagship democracy, even bother to vote at all? </i></p>
<p><i>Could it be that "democracy," long the catch-word of every revolution
and resistance, is simply not democratic enough? What could be more democratic?
</i></p>
<h3>Every little child can grow up to be President.</h3>
<p>No they can't. Being president means holding a hierarchical position
of power, just like being a billionaire: for every one president, there
have to be millions of people with less power. And just as it is for billionaires,
it is for presidents: it's not any coincidence that the two types tend
to rub shoulders, since they both come from a privileged world off limits
to the rest of us. Our economy isn't democratic, either, you know: resources
are distributed in absurdly unequal proportions, and you certainly do
have to start with resources to become President, or even to get your
hands on more resources. </p>
<p> Even if it was true that anyone <i>could</i> grow up to be President,
that wouldn't help the millions of us who inevitably don't, who must still
live in the shadow of that power. This is an intrinsic structural difficulty
in representative democracy, and it occurs on the local level as much
as at the top. For example: the town council, consisting of professional
politicians, can meet, discuss municipal affairs, and pass ordinances
all day, without consulting the citizens of the town, who have to be at
work; when one of those ordinances inconveniences or angers some of the
citizens, they have to go to great lengths to use their free time to contest
it, and then they're gone again the next time the town council meets.
The citizens can elect a different town council from the available pool
of politicians and would-be politicians, but the interests and powers
of the class of politicians as a whole will still be in conflict with
their own&#151;and anyway, party loyalties and similar superstitions usually
prevent them from taking even this step. </p>
<p>If there was no President, our "democracy" would still be less than democratic.
Corruption, privilege, and hierarchy aside, our system purports to operate
by majority rule, with the rights of the minorities protected by a system
of checks and balances&#151;and this method of government has inherent flaws
of its own. </p>
<h3>The tyranny of the majority</h3>
<p>If you ever happened to end up in a vastly outnumbered minority group,
and the majority voted that you must give up something as necessary to
your life as water and air, would you comply? When it comes down to it,
does anyone really believe in recognizing the authority of a group simply
because they outnumber everyone else? We accept majority rule because
we do not believe it will threaten <i>us</i>&#151;and those it does threaten
are already silenced before we can hear their misgivings. </p>
<p>No "average citizen" considers himself threatened by majority rule, because
each one thinks of himself as having the power and righteous "moral authority"
of the majority: if not in fact (by being so-called "normal" or "moderate"),
then in theory, because his ideas are "right" (that is, he believes that
everyone would be convinced of the truth of his arguments, if only they
would listen sincerely). Majority-rule democracy has always rested on
the conviction that if all the facts were clear, everyone could be made
to see that there is only one right course of action&#151;without this belief,
it amounts to nothing more than the dictatorship of the herd. But such
is not always the case&#151;even if "the facts" could be made equally clear
to everyone, which is obviously impossible, some things simply can't be
agreed upon, for there <i>is</i> more than one truth. We need a democracy
that takes these situations into account, in which we are free from the
mob rule of the majority as well as the ascendancy of the privileged class.
. . </p>
<h3>"The Rule of Law"</h3>
<p>. . .and the protection afforded by the "checks and balances" of our
legal institution is <i>not</i> sufficient to establish it. The "rule
of just and equal law," as fetishized today by those whose interests it
protects (the stockbrokers and landlords, for example), does not protect
anyone from chaos or injustice; it simply creates another arena of specialization,
in which the power of our communities is ceded to the jurisdiction of
expensive lawyers and pompous judges. The rights of the <i>minorities</i>
are the very last thing to be protected by these checks and balances,
since power is already reserved for those with the privilege to seize
it, and then for the lumpen majority after them. Under these conditions,
a minority group is only able to use the courts to obtain its rights when
it is able to bring sufficient force upon them in the form of financial
clout, guileful rhetoric, etc. </p>
<p>There is no way to establish justice in a society through the mere drawing
up and enforcement of laws: such laws can only institutionalize what is
already the rule in that society. Common sense and compassion are always
preferable to adherence to a strict and antiquated table of law, anyway,
and where the law is the private province of a curator elite, these inevitably
end up in conflict; what we really need is a social system which fosters
such qualities in its members, and rewards them in practice. To create
such a thing, we must leave representative "democracy" for fully <i>participatory</i>
democracy. </p>
<h3>It's no coincidence "freedom" is not on the ballot.</h3>
<p>Freedom is <i>not</i> a condition&#151;it is something closer to a sensation.
It's not a concept to pledge allegiance to, a cause to serve, or a standard
to march under; it is an experience you must live every day, or else it
will escape you. It is not freedom in action when the flags are flying
and the bombs are dropping to "make the world safe for democracy," no
matter what color the flags are (even black!); freedom cannot be caught
and held in any state system or philosophical doctrine, and it certainly
cannot be enforced or "given" to others&#151;the most you can hope is to free
others from forces preventing them from finding it themselves. It appears
in fragile moments: in the make-believe of young children, the cooperation
of friends on a camping trip, the workers who refuse to follow the union's
orders and instead organize their own strike without leaders. If we are
to be real freedom fighters, we must begin by pledging ourselves to chase
and cherish these moments and seek to expand them, rather than getting
caught up in serving some party or ideology. </p>
<p><i>Real freedom cannot be held on a voting ballot. Freedom doesn't mean
simply being able to choose between options&#151;it means actively participating
in shaping the options in the first place, creating and re-creating the
environments in which options exist</i>. Without this, we have nothing,
for given the same options in the same situations over and over, we'll
always make the same pre-determined decisions. If the context is out of
our hands, so is the choice itself. And when it comes to taking power
over the circumstances of our lives, no one can "represent" us&#151;it's something
we have to do ourselves. </p>
<h3>"Look, a ballot box&#151;democracy!!"</h3>
<p>If the freedom so many generations have fought and died for is best exemplified
by a man in a voting booth, who checks a box on the ballot before returning
to work in an environment no more under his control than it was an hour
before, then the heritage our emancipating forefathers and suffragette
grandmothers have left us is nothing but a sham substitute for the true
liberty they lusted after. </p>
<p>For a better illustration of real freedom in action, look at the musician
in the act of improvising with her companions: in joyous, seemingly effortless
cooperation, they actively create the sonic and emotional environment
in which they exist, participating thus in the transformation of the world
which in turn transforms them. Take this model and extend it to every
one of our interactions with each other, and you would have something
qualitatively different from our present system: a harmony in human relationships
and activity, a real democracy. To get there, we have to dispense with
voting as the archetypal expression of freedom and participation. </p>
<h3>Representative democracy is a contradiction in terms.</h3>
<p>No one can represent your power and interests for you&#151;you can only have
power by acting, and you can only know what your interests are by being
involved. Politicians have made careers out of claiming to represent others,
as if freedom and political power could be held by proxy. Now, inevitably,
they have become a priest caste that answers only to itself&#151;as politician
classes have always been, and will always be. </p>
<p>Voting is an expression of our powerlessness: it is an admission that
we can only approach the resources and capabilities of our own society
through the mediation of that priest caste. When we let them prefabricate
our options for us, we relinquish control of our communities to these
politicians in the same way that we leave technology to scientists, health
to doctors, living environments to city planners and private real estate
developers; we end up living in a world that is alien to us, even though
our labor has built it, for we have acted like sleepwalkers hypnotized
by the monopoly our leaders and specialists hold on setting the possibilities.
</p>
<p>The fact is we don't have to simply choose between presidential candidates,
soft drink brands, competing activist organizations, television shows,
news magazines, political ideologies. We can make our own decisions as
individuals and communities, we can make our own delicious beverages and
action coalitions and magazines and entertainment, we can create our own
individual approaches to life that leave our unique perspectives intact.
Here's how. </p>
<p class="grandemenor">What are the democratic alternatives to democracy?</p>
<h3>Consensus</h3>
<p>Radically participatory democracy, also known as consensus democracy,
is already well-known and practiced across the globe, from indigenous
communities in Latin America to postmodern political action cells ("affinity
groups") in the United States and organic farming cooperatives in Australia.
In contrast to representative democracy, consensus democracy is direct
democracy: the participants get to share in the decision-making process
on a daily basis, and through decentralization of knowledge and authority
they are able to exercise real control over their daily lives. Unlike
majority-rule democracy, consensus democracy values the needs and concerns
of each individual equally; if one person is unhappy with a resolution,
then it is everyone's responsibility to find a new solution that is acceptable
to all. Consensus democracy does not demand that any person accept the
power of others over her life, though it does require that everybody be
willing to consider the needs of everyone else; thus what it loses in
efficiency, it gains tenfold in both freedom and goodwill. Consensus democracy
does not ask that people follow a leader or standardize themselves under
some common cause; rather, its aim is to integrate all into a working
whole while allowing each to retain her own goals and ways of doing things.
</p>
<h3>Autonomy</h3>
<p>In order for direct democracy to be meaningful, people must have control
over their immediate surroundings and the basic matters of their lives.
Autonomy is simply the idea that no one is more qualified than you are
to decide how you live, that no one should be able to vote on what you
do with your time and your potential&#151;or for that matter how the environment
you live in is constructed. It is not to be confused with so-called "independence"&#151;
in actuality, <i>no</i> one is independent, since our lives all depend
on each other ("Western man fills his closet with groceries, and call
himself self-sufficient")&#151;that's just an individualist myth that keeps
us collectively at odds. The glamorization of "self-sufficiency" in the
present cutthroat-competitive society really constitutes an attack on
those who will not exploit others to "take care of themselves," and thus
functions as an obstacle to community building<a class="footnote" href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return overlib('The politicians&rsquo; myth of &ldquo;welfare mothers&rdquo; snatching the hardworking citizen&rsquo;s rightful earnings from him, for example, divides individuals who might otherwise unite to form cooperative groups with no use for those politicians.', CAPTION, '[1]');" onmouseout="nd();">[1]</a>.
In contrast to this Western mirage, autonomy is a free <i>interdependence</i>
between those with whom you share a consensus, with whom you act freely
(i.e. without waiting for permission or instructions from anyone else)
in order to cooperatively establish self-management of the whole of life.
</p>
<p>Autonomy is the antithesis of bureaucracy. For autonomy to be possible,
every aspect of the community from technology to history must be organized
in such a way that it is accessible to everyone; and for it to work, everyone
must make use of this access. </p>
<p>Autonomous groups can be formed without necessarily establishing a clear
agenda, so long as they offer the members ways to benefit from each others'
participation: the CrimethInc. Collective, the Dada movement, and knitting
circles of the past and present all offer evidence of this. Such groups
can even contain contradictions, just as each of us does individually,
and still serve their purpose. The days of marching under a single flag
are over. </p>
<p>Autonomous groups have a stake in defending themselves against the encroachments
of others who do not believe in the rights of individuals to govern themselves,
and expanding the territory of autonomy and consensus by doing everything
in their power to both destroy the structures of coercive societies (including
those of representative "democracy") and replace them with more radically
democratic structures. For example, it's not enough just to block or destroy
highways that are creating noise and air pollution; you also have to provide
free transportation by means such as communal bicycles and community repair
centers, if you want to help others replace the competitive/authoritarian
relations of car dependency with cooperative/autonomous means of transportation.
</p>
<h3>Direct Action</h3>
<p>Autonomy means direct action, not waiting for requests to pass through
the "established channels" only to bog down in paperwork and endless
negotiations. Establish your own channels. If you want hungry people
to eat, don't just give money to some high-handed charity bureaucracy;
find out where food is going to waste, collect it, and feed them. If
you want affordable housing, don't try to get the town council to pass
a bill&#151;that will take years, while people sleep outside every night;
take over abandoned buildings and share them, and organize groups to
defend them when the thugs of the absentee landlords show up. If you
want corporations to have less power, don't petition the politicians
they bought to put limits on their own masters; find ways to work with
others to simply take the power from them: don't buy their products,
don't work for them, sabotage their billboards and buildings, prevent
their meetings from taking place and their merchandise from being delivered.
They use similar tactics to exert their power over you; it only looks
valid because they bought the laws and social customs, too. </p>
<p>Don't wait for permission or organization from some outside authority,
don't beg some higher power to organize your life for you. Act. </p>
<h3>Topless Federations</h3>
<p>Independent autonomous groups can work together in federations without
any particular group holding authority. Such a social structure sounds
utopian, but it can actually be quite practical and efficient. International
mail and railroad travel both currently work on this system, to name two
examples: while the individual postal and transportation systems are internally
hierarchical, they all cooperate together to get mail or rail passengers
from one nation to another, without an ultimate authority being necessary
at any point in the process. Similarly, individuals who cannot agree on
enough issues to be able to work together within one collective should
still be able to see the importance of being able to coexist with other
groups. For such a thing to work in the long run, of course, we need to
instill values of cooperation, consideration, and tolerance in the coming
generations&#151;but that is exactly what we are proposing. </p>
<h3>How to solve disagreements without calling "the authorities"</h3>
<p>In a social arrangement which is truly in the best interest of each participating
individual, exclusion from the community should be threat enough to discourage
violent or destructive behavior. It is certainly a more humanitarian approach
than authoritarian means such as prisons and executions, which corrupt
the judges as much as they embitter the criminals. Those who refuse to
integrate themselves into any community and reject the assistance and
generosity of others may find themselves banished from human interaction;
but that is still better than exile in the mental ward, or on death row,
two of the options which await such men today. Violence should only be
used by communities in defense, not with the smug entitlement of post-divine
judgment with which it is applied by our present injustice system. This
applies as well to the interactions of autonomous/consensus groups with
the "outside world" which does not yet abide by cooperative or tolerant
values. </p>
<p>Serious disagreements within communities can be solved in many cases
by reorganizing or dividing the groups. Often individuals who can't get
along in one social configuration will have much more success cooperating
in another setting, or as members of parallel communities. If consensus
cannot be met within a group, that group should split into smaller groups
who can achieve it internally&#151;such a thing may be inconvenient and frustrating,
but it is better than group decisions ultimately being made by force by
those who have the most power and ruthlessness at their disposal. All
the independent communities will still have it in their best interest
to coexist peacefully, and must somehow negotiate ways to achieve this.
. . </p>
<h3>Living without permission</h3>
<p>. . .that's the most difficult part, of course. But we're not talking
about just another social system here, we're talking about a total revolution
of human relations&#151;for that is what it will take to solve the problems
our species faces today. Let's not kid ourselves&#151;until we can achieve
this, the violence and strife inherent in non-consensus relations will
continue, and <i>no</i> law or system will be able to protect us. The
best reason to transcend representative democracy is simply that in consensus
democracy there are no fake solutions, no easy ways of suppressing conflict
without resolving it, and thus those who participate in it <i>must</i>
learn to coexist without coercion and submission and all those other nasty
habits we are so tired of in our present society. </p>
<p>The first precious grains of this new world can be found in your friendships
and love affairs, when they are free from power relations and cooperation
occurs naturally. Take this model, and expand it to the whole of society&#151;
that is the world "beyond democracy" for which the heart cries out today.
</p>
<p> It seems a challenging prospect to get there from here. . . but the
wonderful thing about consensus/autonomy is that you don't have to wait
for the government to vote for them to apply these concepts&#151;you can practice
them right now with the people around you, and benefit immediately. Once
put into practice, the virtues of this way of living will be clear to
others; they need no pointing out once one is experiencing them firsthand.
Form your own autonomous group, answering to no power but your own, and
create an environment in which you chase down freedom and fulfillment
for yourselves, if your representatives will not do it for you&#151;since they
<i>cannot</i> do it "for" you. From such seeds, the real democracy of
the future will grow. </p>
<p>Next time we state our demands and grievances and they refuse to acknowledge
them, saying "just be thankful you live in a democracy," we'll be ready
to respond: <i>That's not enough!</i> . . .and know clearly what we want
instead, from our own experience. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Whoever they vote for, we are ungovernable!</h5>
<h5>20,000 channels is not enough.</h5>
