<h1>The Contents of Your Daily Life</h1>
<p>How many hours a day do you spend in front of a television screen? A
computer screen? Behind an automobile windscreen? All three screens combined?
What are you being screened from? How much of your life comes at you through
a screen, vicariously? </p>
<p>Is watching things as exciting as doing things? Do you have enough time
to do all the things that you want to? Do you have enough energy to? Why?
And how many hours a day do you sleep? How are you affected by standardized
time, designed solely to synchronize your movements with those of millions
of other people? How long do you ever go without knowing what time it
is? Who or what controls your minutes and hours? The minutes and hours
that add up to your life? Are you saving time? Saving it up for what?
</p>
<p>Can you put a value on a beautiful day, when the birds are singing and
people are walking around together? How many dollars an hour does it take
to pay you to stay inside and sell things or file papers? What can you
get later that will make up for this day of your life? </p>
<p>How are you affected by being in crowds, by being surrounded by anonymous
masses? Do you find yourself blocking your emotional responses to other
human beings? And who prepares your meals? Do you ever eat by yourself?
Do you ever eat standing up? How much do you know about what you eat and
where it comes from? How much do you trust it? </p>
<p>What are we deprived of by labor-saving devices? By thought-saving devices?
How are you affected by the requirements of efficiency, which place value
on the product rather than the process, on the future rather than the
present, the present moment that is getting shorter and shorter as we
speed faster and faster into the future? What are we speeding towards?
Are we saving time? Saving it up for what? </p>
<p>How are you affected by being moved around in prescribed paths, in elevators,
buses, subways, escalators, on highways and sidewalks? By moving, working,
and living in two- and three-dimensional grids? How are you affected by
being organized, immobilized, and scheduled rather than wandering, roaming
freely and spontaneously? Scavenging? (Shoplifting?) How much freedom
of movement do you have--freedom to move through space, to move as far
as you want, in new and unexplored directions? </p>
<p>And how are you affected by waiting? Waiting in line, waiting in traffic,
waiting to eat, waiting for the bus, waiting to urinate--learning to punish
and ignore your spontaneous urges? How are you affected by holding back
your desires? By sexual repression, by the delay or denial of pleasure,
starting in childhood, along with the suppression of everything in you
that is spontaneous, everything that evidences your wild nature, your
membership in the animal kingdom? Is pleasure dangerous? </p>
<p>Could danger be joyous? Do you ever need to see the sky? (Can you see
many stars in it any more?) Do you ever need to see water, leaves, foliage,
animals? Glinting, glimmering, moving? Is that why you have a pet, an
aquarium, houseplants? Or are television and video your glinting, glimmering,
moving? How much of your life comes at you through a screen, vicariously?
If your life was made into a movie, would you watch it? How do you feel
in situations of enforced passivity? </p>
<p>How are you affected by a non-stop assault of symbolic communication--audio,
visual, print, billboard, video, radio, robotic voices--as you wander
through a forest of signs? What are they urging upon you? Do you ever
need solitude, quiet, contemplation? Do you remember it? Thinking on your
own, rather than reacting to stimuli? Is it hard to look away?</p>
<p> Is looking away the very thing that is not permitted? Where can you
go to find silence and solitude? Not white noise, but pure silence? Not
loneliness, but gentle solitude? How often have you stopped to ask yourself
questions like these? Do you find yourself committing acts of symbolic
violence? Do you ever feel lonely in a way that words cannot even express?        </p>
<h5>Do you sometimes feel yourself ready<br />to LOSE CONTROL?</h5>
