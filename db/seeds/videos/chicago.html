<span class="title">The Chicago Conspiracy</span>
<span class="info">HD / 2010 / 94 Minutes</span>
<span class="desc">This documentary addresses the legacy of the military dictatorship in Chile by sharing the story of   combatant youth who were killed by the Pinochet regime as a backdrop to the history of the military dictatorship and current social conflict in the area. The larger story is wrapped around three shorter pieces, which explore the student movement, the history of neighborhoods that became centers of armed resistance against the dictatorship, and the indigenous Mapuche conflict. The filmmakers, militant film collective Subversive Action Films, question their relationship to the documentary, taking a position as combatants. [1280x720]</span>
