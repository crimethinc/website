          We depend on readers like you to fund our activities. If you value the resources we offer here, please consider supporting us financially. Your contribution makes it possible for us to provide a website without advertisements or paywalls, to pay our authors and editors, to offset expenses for our other projects, and to continually expand and improve what we have to offer.

          Our work is a gift to the movements for liberation and the revolution-to-come, but it also costs a lot! For a small collective, we keep a lot of servers running, manage a lot of logistics, and maintain momentum on a lot of projects. [Your support is invaluable to us.](http://www.crimethinc.com/blog/2017/01/30/how-much-force-are-you-using-an-open-letter-to-the-law-enforcement-agents-assigned-to-investigate-political-dissidents)

          We offer a monthly subscription option and one-time donations. Please choose what works best for you!

          Thank you so much for supporting CrimethInc.! Because we are a decentralized collective, it is not possible for us to offer the same sorts of perks that organizations with more formal structures use as fundraising incentives. What we can do is promise that every contribution helps us to keep this material free, to distribute it as widely as possible, to continue creating new resources, and to work together towards the realization of a freer world.

          _Keep checking back! Our site is updated daily, there's always something new._
