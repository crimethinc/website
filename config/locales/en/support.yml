          _Use the slider to adjust your donation._
          _No amount is too big to be needed or too small to be helpful!_
          _If you can, sign up to donate on a monthly basis,_
          _so we can count on you to sustain us for the long haul._

          CrimethInc. is an all-volunteer project with no outside sources of funding.
          We offer everything we do for free or at break-even prices while maintaining
          some of the highest quality standards in our field.
          We publish constantly, circulating material in [over 30 languages](/tce) on
          [all seven continents](/2008/01/06/now-serving-seven-continents).
          We've kept this up for a quarter of a century.

          We do all this on a shoestring budget—but despite our ingenuity, some expenses are unavoidable.
          We depend on your assistance to cover those.
          With more resources, we could expand to utilize more formats and free up time to publish even more frequently.

          As always, of course, the very best way to support what we are doing is to _do it yourself._

          Thank you so much for supporting CrimethInc.!
          Because we are a decentralized collective,
          it is not possible for us to offer the same sorts of perks that organizations
          with more formal structures use as fundraising incentives.
          What we can do is promise that every contribution helps us to keep this material free,
          to distribute it as widely as possible, to continue creating new resources,
          and to work together towards the realization of a freer world.

          _Keep checking back! Our site is updated daily, there's always something new._
