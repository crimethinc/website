      description:
        "CrimethInc. is a rebel alliance—a decentralized network pledged to anonymous collective action—a breakout from the prisons of our age. We strive to reinvent our lives and our world according to the principles of self-determination and mutual aid.

        We believe that you should be free to dispose of your limitless potential on your own terms: that no government, market, or ideology should be able to dictate what your life can be. If you agree, *let’s do something about it.*"

    mantra:
      - If your heart is free, the ground you stand on is liberated territory. Defend it.
      - Only those prepared to go too far will learn how far they can go.
      - Desperate measures are long overdue.
      - Cradle the seed, even in the volcano’s mouth.
      - The future is in chains within you — set it free.
      - A spark for every powder keg.
      - Esperanza no espera.
