Into Libraries program](/books/into-libraries). Our books are [in more libraries than you might guess](/2007/10/09/crimethinc-into-libraries-progress-report), and if not, you can probably get them onto the shelves, for free. [Find out how!](/books/into-libraries)

      literature_distro_kit_intro: Our books are the cornerstone of our [Literature Distribution Kit](/books/lit-kit), an all-in-one literature distro for you to deploy how you see fit.

          _Use the slider to adjust your donation. No amount is too big to be needed or too small to be helpful! If you can, sign up to donate on a monthly basis, so we can count on you to sustain us for the long haul._

          CrimethInc. is an all-volunteer project with no outside sources of funding. We offer everything we do for free or at break-even prices while maintaining some of the highest quality standards in our field. We publish constantly, circulating material in [over 30 languages](/tce) on [all seven continents](/2008/01/06/now-serving-seven-continents). We‚Äôve kept this up for a quarter of a century.

          We do all this on a shoestring budget‚Äîbut despite our ingenuity, some expenses are unavoidable. We depend on your assistance to cover those. With more resources, we could expand to utilize more formats and free up time to publish even more frequently.

          As always, of course, the very best way to support what we are doing is to _do it yourself._
