  # in development/staging we often download production data and load

  # uploaded via ActiveStorage. We get the below error whenever trying
  # to generate an image url:
  #
  #  ActionView::Template::Error (undefined method `signed_id' for nil:NilClass):
  #
  # This is because the development/staging ActiveStorage tables don't
  # (and cannot) match up with the actual ActiveStorage storage used
  # in these environments (e.g. the staging env points to aa different
  # # AWS instance than the production env)
  #
  # This is a bit of a stopgap until we figure out a better way of
  # handling this issue.
